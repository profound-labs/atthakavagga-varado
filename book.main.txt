Kāma Sutta
ON SENSUAL PLEASURE
If a person craving for sensual pleasure is satisﬁed,
He’s delighted, yes,
The mortal who gets what he wants.

766.

kāmaṃ kāmayamānassa,
tassa ce taṃ samijjhati.
addhā pītimano hoti,
laddhā macco yadicchati.
But that person,
Craving and longing,
If his pleasures diminish,
He suﬀers as if pierced with an arrow.

767.

tassa ce kāmayānassa,
chandajātassa jantuno.
te kāmā parihāyanti,
sallaviddhova ruppati.
Whoever, attentive, avoids sensual pleasure
As he might, with his foot, the head of a snake,
Leaves behind this attachment to the world.
yo kāme parivajjeti,
sappasseva padā siro.
somaṃ visattikaṃ loke,
sato samativattati.

1. ON SENSUAL PLEASURE

769.
770.

A man who is greedy
For ﬁelds, property and gold,
Cattle and horses,
Slaves, servants, maids and relatives,
And many sensual pleasures
Is overpowered by what is weak
And is crushed by troubles.
Sorrow invades him like water into a leaky boat.
khettaṃ vatthuṃ hiraññaṃ vā,
gavassaṃ dāsaporisaṃ.
thiyo bandhū puthu kāme,
yo naro anugijjhati.
abalā naṃ balīyanti,
maddantenaṃ parissayā.
tato naṃ dukkhamanveti,
nāvaṃ bhinnamivodakaṃ.

771.

So a person, ever attentive,
Should avoid the objects of desire.
Having forsaken them
He will cross the ﬂood of sorrow [1]
Like one, having bailed out a boat,
Who reaches the further shore.
tasmā jantu sadā sato,
kāmāni parivajjaye.
te pahāya tare oghaṃ,
nāvaṃ sitvāva pāragūti.

Guhaṭṭhaka Sutta
ON CAVE ABIDING

Abiding in a cave,
Attached to existence, [1]
Covered in deﬁlement and immersed in delusion,
A man is truly far from solitude. [2]
Forsaking the pleasures of the world is truly diﬃcult.

772.

satto guhāyaṃ bahunābhichanno,
tiṭṭhaṃ naro mohanasmiṃ pagāḷho.
dūre vivekā hi tathāvidho so,
kāmā hi loke na hi suppahāyā.
Those fettered by desire,
Bound to the pleasures of existence,
Are not easily liberated.
Indeed, there is no liberation
Except in regard to such ties.
Wishing for the future and the past,
Hungering for present and former pleasures:
Those who are greedy for sensual enjoyment,
Hunting for it,
Stupiﬁed by it,
Become selﬁsh about it,
Have entered upon a diﬃcult path.
When drawn into diﬃculty, they lament:
‘What will become of us in the hereafter?’

775.

So, people should indeed
train themselves in this world.
Whatever one knows to be wrong,
Do not for its sake engage in misconduct.
For the wise say that life is short.

776.

I see people in this world writhing,
Oppressed by clinging to existence,
Wretched characters wailing in the face of death
With their clinging
to various forms of existence unallayed.
passāmi loke pariphandamānaṃ,
pajaṃ imaṃ taṇhagataṃ bhavesu.
hīnā narā maccumukhe lapanti,
avītataṇhāse bhavābhavesu.

777.

Look at them,
Writhing amidst their beloved possessions
Like ﬁsh in a dwindling stream.

GUHAṬṬHAKA SUTTA

Having seen this,
You should live without possessiveness
And not get attached to existence.
mamāyite passatha phandamāne,
maccheva appodake khīṇasote.
etampi disvā amamo careyya,
bhavesu āsattimakubbamāno.
You should subdue longing
for all that is past or to come.
Having understood sense contact,
Being free of greed,
A wise person does nothing for which
he would blame himself.
For whatever he sees or hears
He is not stained by possessiveness. [3]

778.

ubhosu antesu vineyya chandaṃ,
phassaṃ pariññāya anānugiddho.

Having understood ﬁctitious perceptions, [4]
Not stained by possessiveness,
The sage crosses the ﬂood of sorrow. [5]
With the arrow of suﬀering removed. [6]
Living diligently,
He longs for neither this world or the next.

779.

nāsīsatī lokamimaṃ parañcāti.

2. ON CAVE ABIDING

Notes
1. Verse 777 says attachment (satto) is in relation to existence (bhavesu), therefore I call satto ‘attached to existence’.
2. See The Octads in a Nutshell: Abiding in solitude, page 108.
3. Verse 779 says the ‘stain’ is that of possessiveness, so I call it
that here.
4. ﬁctitious perceptions: saññaṃ, see Translation Notes, page 170.
5. In verse 771, I called oghaṃ ‘the ﬂood of sorrow’; so here, too.
6. Verse 767 says the ‘arrow’ is the suﬀering experienced when
pleasure diminishes in someone who craves for it. Therefore I
call sallo ‘the arrow of suﬀering’.

Duṭṭhaṭṭhaka Sutta
ON THE EVIL-MINDED

Those who are evil-minded dispute
– of course.
But some whose hearts are set on Truth
also dispute.
However, a sage does not enter a dispute
that has arisen.
Therefore, he nowhere inclines
to hard heartedness. [1]

780.

vadanti ve duṭṭhamanāpi eke,
athopi ve saccamanā vadanti.
vādañca jātaṃ muni no upeti,
tasmā munī natthi khilo kuhiñci.
How could someone motivated by longing,
Bent on pleasure,
Overcome the ﬁxed views
which he has himself concocted?
Having come to his own conclusions,
Then, just as he sees things,
So would he speak.
sakañhi diṭṭhiṃ kathamaccayeyya,
chandānunīto ruciyā niviṭṭho.

3. ON THE EVIL-MINDED

782.

Whoever unasked,
Boasts to others of his precepts and practices,
Speaking of himself of his own accord,
Is ignoble, say the good.
yo attano sīlavatāni jantu,
anānupuṭṭhova paresa pāva.
anariyadhammaṃ kusalā tamāhu,
yo ātumānaṃ sayameva pāva.

783.

But a monk who is peaceful,
Having completely extinguished the illusion of Self,
Who does not boast about his virtue, ‘I am like this’,
Who is not conceited about anything in the world
Is noble, say the good.
santo ca bhikkhu abhinibbutatto,
itihanti sīlesu akatthamāno.
tamariyadhammaṃ kusalā vadanti,

784.

He whose religious teachings have been
Concocted,
Conjured up,
And blindly followed
Is not cleansed. [2]
Whatever good result from them
he might see in himself,
If he is tethered to that result,
Any satisfaction he feels is dependent
on what is unstable.

It is not easy to transcend opinionatedness [3]
in regards to dogmatic religious teachings. [4]
Because of this, men reject or accept religious
teachings in accordance with their opinions.

785.

One who is puriﬁed
Concocts no ﬁxed view about anything in existence.

By what attachment would such a person go?
He is without attachment.

One who is attached argues
over religious teachings.
But how, and about what, can you argue
with one who is without attachment?
For him there is nothing clung to,
and nothing to relinquish.
He has shaken oﬀ every ﬁxed view
in this very world.

Suddhaṭṭhaka Sutta
ON PURITY

‘I see Purity, the highest Goal, the Non-Aﬄicted: [1]
A man’s puriﬁcation is intrinsic to his vision.’ [2]
Knowing such knowledge as ‘the highest Goal’
A ‘Seer of Purity’ reverts to knowledge.

788.

passāmi suddhaṃ paramaṃ arogaṃ,
diṭṭhena saṃsuddhi narassa hoti.
evābhijānaṃ paramanti ñatvā,
suddhānupassīti pacceti ñāṇaṃ.
If a man’s puriﬁcation is intrinsic to his vision,
If forsaking sorrow is intrinsic to his knowledge,
Then a person with one basis of attachment
Is intrinsically puriﬁed by means of another. [3]
The view of one who asserts purity in this way
is thus belied.

789.

diṭṭhena ce suddhi narassa hoti,
ñāṇena vā so pajahāti dukkhaṃ.
aññena so sujjhati sopadhīko,
diṭṭhī hi naṃ pāva tathā vadānaṃ.
No Brahman says that puriﬁcation
is intrinsic to an auxiliary basis of attachment, [4]
Either to what is seen, heard or cognised,
or to precepts and practices.
17

790.

4. ON PURITY

A Brahman is not stained by merit or evil.
Forsaking whatever he was clinging to,
He does not make further attachments
in the world. [5]
na brāhmaṇo aññato suddhimāha,
diṭṭhe sute sīlavate mute vā.
puññe ca pāpe ca anūpalitto,
attañjaho nayidha pakubbamāno.
791.

Those following craving,
Forsaking what they have
in order to grab something diﬀerent,
Do not cross over attachment.
They release and catch hold –
Like a monkey releasing one branch
in order to seize another.
purimaṃ pahāya aparaṃ sitāse,
ejānugā te na taranti saṅgaṃ.
te uggahāyanti nirassajanti,
kapīva sākhaṃ pamuñcaṃ gahāyaṃ.
A person attached to ﬁctitious perceptions [6]
Who undertakes religious practices of his own
Goes high and low.
But one of great wisdom,
One knowing the Buddha’s teaching, a sage,
Does not go high and low.

792.

sayaṃ samādāya vatāni jantu,

Ones like him neither concoct religious teachings
Nor blindly follow them. [7]
They do not proclaim of any teaching
‘This itself is ﬁnal puriﬁcation’.
Having loosened the knot of grasping
with which they are bound
They do not hope for anything in the world.

794.

The Brahman has gone beyond
conventional boundaries.
He has grasped nothing,

He is not overcome by lust,
nor overwhelmed by disgust.
There is nothing in the world
grasped by him as the highest Goal. [8]

Notes
1. The Buddha used these same epithets for Nibbāna: suddhiṃ
(S.4.372); paramaṃ) (Dh v.184); ārogya (M.1.510).
2. A ‘seer of purity’ thinks a man’s purity is intrinsic to his vision,
unlike a wise person, ‘who does not relish what is seen or heard’
(v.897).
3. by means of another: aññena, see Translation Notes, page 161.
4. ‘some auxiliary basis of attachment’: translation of aññato in
the context of verse 789.
5. nayidha pakubbamāno: Norman has ‘does not fashion [anything
more] here’. This is because pakaroti means ‘eﬀect, perform, prepare, make, do’ (PED). But the verse is about purity through nonattachment. I translate the verse accordingly: ‘He does not make
any more attachments in this world’.
6. ﬁctitious perceptions: saññaṃ, see Translation Notes, page 170.
7. blindly follow: purakkhatā, see Translation Notes, page 179. In
verse 784 it refers to religious teachings (dhammā), and is therefore
rendered as such here.

Paramaṭṭhaka Sutta
ON THE HIGHEST GOAL

If a person maintains that of views,
his view is the highest Goal, [1], [2]
Holding it as supreme in the world,
And says that all other views are contemptible,
Then he has not gone beyond disputes.

796.

hīnāti aññe tato sabbamāha,

When a person sees an advantage for himself
In what is seen, heard, or cognised,
Or in precepts and practices,
He grasps such things,
Regarding everything else as contemptible.

797.

The good call that thing a bond,
If, tethered to it,

Nor to precepts and practices.

He should not concoct ﬁxed views about others [3]
Based upon his knowledge of either them
Or of their precepts and practices.
He should neither suggest that he is equal,
Nor suppose that he is either inferior or superior.

And taking possession of nothing further –

5. ON THE HIGHEST GOAL

Notes
1. A person who maintains that of views, his view is the highest
Goal can be compared with the sage who does ‘not proclaim of
any teaching “This itself is ﬁnal puriﬁcation” ’ (v.794).
2. The highest Goal: paramaṃ, see: Translation Notes, page 169.
3. concoct ﬁxed views about others (i.e. other people): PED’s
alternative translation of loka.
4. The ‘should not’: the whole verse is apparently meant in the
optative case.
5. ﬁctitious perception: saññā, see Translation Notes, page 170.
6. The sage has grasped no view about anything: namely, views
about Truth and purity (v.824), dogmatic religious teachings
(vv.785, 837, 910), existence (v.786), or about the world (v.799).
Grasping a view means thinking it is the highest Goal (v.833); or
that other people’s views are contemptible (v.797).
7. concoct and blindly follow: I adopt the sense of v.784, where
the terms refer to religious teachings.
8. The Buddha’s teachings: dhammā. In the Octads, the Buddha’s
teachings are sometimes called sāsanaṃ (vv.814, 815, 933, 944).

He does not suppose
That he is intrinsically puriﬁed

Nor does he want to be thus puriﬁed

By nothing is he either attracted or repelled. [4]
dhono na hi tena maññati,
yadidaṃ diṭṭhasutaṃ mutesu vā.
nāññena visuddhimicchati,
na hi so rajjati no virajjatīti.

Notes
1. ﬁtting: Critical Pali Dictionary calls asāmaggiya ‘want of concord, disharmony’. Sāmaggiya would thus be ‘harmonious’ or ‘ﬁtting’. Norman has ‘agreeable’.
2. nopalimpati: from the reference in the previous verse, I have
taken as ‘stained by lamentation and selﬁshness’.
3. by some auxiliary basis of attachment: āññena, see: Translation
Notes, p. 161.
4. neither attracted nor repelled. This continues a theme of v.811:
‘He does not regard anything as either loved or hated’. For virajjati, Norman has ‘dispassioned’. But in the context of v.811 it
would mean ‘repelled’.

1. Worldly attachment: although gedha means greed, I call it ‘worldly
attachment’ because the PED says the two words are closely linked.
Norman calls it ‘great entanglement’. It seems that blame, one of

to.

Māgaṇḍiya Sutta

Dialogue on the occasion of Māgaṇḍiya’s oﬀer of his daughter to the Buddha.

(The Buddha)
Seeing even Taṇhā, Arati and Ragā,
(The three daughters of Māra),
Aroused in me no longing for sexual intercourse. [1]
So for what reason would I want this woman,
Filled as she is with urine and excrement?
I would not want to touch her – even with my foot.

If you do not want such a jewel,
A woman sought after by many kings,
Then what views, precepts, practices,

(The Buddha)
837.

In regards to dogmatic religious teachings,
Of none of them have I said ‘I proclaim this’.
But rather, in scrutinising views, without grasping,
While searching, I realised inner peace.
idaṃ vadāmīti na tassa hoti,
dhammesu niccheyya samuggahītaṃ.
passañca diṭṭhīsu anuggahāya,
ajjhattasantiṃ pacinaṃ adassaṃ.

Of opinions that have been concocted,
You indeed speak without grasping.
This inner peace, which you mentioned, [2]
How is it explained by the wise?

839.

They do not say that puriﬁcation
is intrinsic to views [3]
Learning, knowledge, or precepts and practices;
Nor intrinsic to a lack of views,

But by forsaking these, [4]

At peace, untethered,
One no longer hungers for existence.

Notes
1. The three daughters of Māra attempted to seduce the Buddha
by elaborate means to bring him back under the control of their
father. Māra later told them their attempt had been like battering
a mountain with lotus stalks, or digging a mountain with their
nails, or chewing iron with their teeth. He told them they had
been swept away by the Buddha like wind blows away a cotton
tuft (S.1.124).

4. See: Should monks forsake precepts and practices? page 147.
5. Not grasping views, learning, knowledge, precepts and practices. A similar description of practice is found in the Udāna,

which says that one extreme is to think that religious training is
the essence – or that precepts and practices, or celibacy or service
is the essence (sikkhāsārā sīlabbatajīvitabrahmacariyaupaṭṭhānasārā
ayameko anto). The other extreme is to think that there is no ﬂaw
in sensuality (natthi kāmesu doso’ti ayaṃ dutiyo anto). Both these
extremes ‘cause the cemeteries to grow’. For those who fully understand (abhiññāya) the two extremes, and abandon them, they
escape from saṃsāra (Ud.71-2).
6. The Buddha deﬁnes the goal as being untethered to the path.
This confuses Māgaṇḍiya to the extent that, whereas the Buddha
gave him the deﬁnition of purity, his complaint concerns the attainment of purity. And whereas the Buddha describes the abstract
quality of purity; Māgaṇḍiya asks about purity as a personal attainment.
7. Thus ends the conversation with Māgaṇḍiya.
8. Of what view. Here kiṃ seems to mean ‘what view?’. Also in
v.832 ‘This is very Truth’ refers to views.
9. So-called experts call their religious teachings ‘Truth’ (vv.824,
910). But Truth involves forsaking everything (v.946). So a sage
would ‘not proclaim of any teaching “This itself is ﬁnal puriﬁcation” ’ (v.794). ‘Falsehood’ is a term devised by sophists to label
other people’s ‘Truths’ (v.886).
10. Yasmiṃ samaṃ visamaṃ vāpi natthi. Norman says ‘In whom
there is no (idea of being) equal or unequal either’. A similar
expression in v.799 includes the word maññetha: one must not
‘suppose’ one is either inferior or superior. Therefore I phrase it:
The Brahman who neither supposes he is ‘equal’ nor ‘unequal’.

12. part of himself: tammayo. This word also occurs at M.1.319
and A.3.444; and tammayatā occurs at M.3.42 and M.3.220. Seeing that everything in the world is not part of oneself (sabbaloke
ca atammayo bhavissāmi) is one of the advantages of developing
the notion of not-Self (anattasaññaṃ). Two further advantages
are: It restrains the notion of ‘me’ (ahaṅkārā ca me uparujjhissanti).
It restrains the notion of ‘mine’ (mamaṅkārā ca me uparujjhissanti)
(A.3.444).
13. Not to be inferred by his precepts or practices (na kammunā
… neyyo). I take kammunā as equivalent to sīlavatena of v.803 (na

solitude, page 108.
3. ‘In any way’: a phrase adopted from v.811, where anissito is
said to be sabbattha. Sabbattha seems necessary here too.
4. ‘What does not exist’. Socati in v.851 and v.944 refers to the
past. But in M.1.137 ‘what does not exist externally’ (bahiddhā asati
paritassanāti) means whatever one had in the past that is lost, or
whatever one wants that one has not gained; ‘what does not exist internally’ (ajjhattaṃ asati paritassanāti) means one’s presumed
Self. Any of these meanings would ﬁt here.
5. Dhammesu ca na gacchati: Norman has ‘does not go (astray)
among mental phenomena’. But in the Octads, dhamma usually
means ‘religious teaching/s’ or the ‘Buddha’s teaching’ or ‘Truth’.
Here I take it as ‘religious teachings’. And although Norman has
taken dhammesu as the locative case, it may be functionally an ablative case (Duroiselle, para.601, xvi). The phrase would therefore mean ‘Go by means of religious teachings’ or, in other words
‘Follow religious teachings’. Therefore I have taken the phrase to
be a synonym of dhammā purakkhatā of v.784: not blindly follow
religious teachings.

Notes
1. ‘hope’: PED calls niṭṭhā ‘aim’. This would give ‘aim that a man
has for the next life’. I call this ‘hope’. Norman calls it ‘fulﬁllment
[of hope]’ which does not ﬁt the context.
2. ‘duality’: I add the word ‘duality’ in v.867 because in v.868
pleasing-displeasing are called dvayameva.
3. ‘apparent’: v.870 says that sense contact is the source of the annihilation and existence of material phenomena. Because this annihilation and existence depends on sense contact, it seems better
to call it ‘apparent’ annihilation and existence, rather than simply ‘annihilation and existence’. Another reason for calling them
‘apparent annihilation’ and ‘apparent existence’ is that the BudTEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

59

11. QUARRELS AND DISPUTES

dha veered away from two extreme views: the view ‘All exists’
(sabbamatthī’ti) and the view ‘All does not exist’ (sabbaṃ natthī’ti)
(S.2.17). Therefore it seems more appropriate to talk in terms of
apparent existence and non-existence, rather than wrongly speak
of actual existence and non-existence.
4. yametamatthaṃ: ‘which you mentioned’, see Translation Notes,
page 170.
5. When material form is annihilated: this is arahantship, because the arahant lays down one body without taking up another
(S.4.55). I call this the annihilation of material form, not the annihilation of the body, because this annihilation involves more than
just the present body, but the potential for future bodies too. Of
his own body, the Buddha said that after his death, devas and
humans would see him no more (D.1.46).
6. ‘material form together with its pleasure and pain’: Norman
phrases this ‘How does happiness or misery disappear also?’ But
the Buddha, in his answer to this question, makes no reference to
sukhaṃ dukhañcāpi. Therefore the two words are obviously adjuncts to the question on material form; they are not meant as a
separate question. Because at v.875 the questioner says ‘You have
explained what we asked’.
7. ‘ﬁctitious perceptions’: see Translation Notes, page 170.
8. The Buddha said he taught a doctrine such that, for the arahant, ﬁctitious perceptions do not linger in him (saññā nānusenti)
(M.1.108). Freedom from ﬁctitious perceptions therefore implies
arahantship.
9. na visaññasaññī: not aware of perverted perceptions. At A.2.52,
visaññino is used as a synonym of saññāvipallāso, perverted perception. This is deﬁned as seeing permanence, happiness, Self
and beauty where there is none (anicce niccan’ti; dukkhe sukhan’ti;
60

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

KALAHAVIVĀDA SUTTA

anattani attā’ti; asubhe subhan’ti).
10. For material form to be annihilated, a person must be not unaware (nopi asaññī). The line implies that for arahantship, awareness must be functioning, as well as the undistorted perception
alluded to in the ﬁrst two lines. Asaññī perhaps refers to the Unaware Gods (asaññasattā nāma devā) (D.1.28). According to this
verse, they cannot annihilate their material form. The Buddha
may have mentioned this in case people assume that the goal
of the holy life is to achieve a state of unawareness. Asaññī cannot here mean the exalted state of saññāvedayitanirodhaṃ (ending
of perception and sensation: S.2.151), in which mental activities
have ceased (cittasaṅkhārā niruddhā), which is a meditation state
that always results in arahantship (M.3.45; M.3.28), and where
the word saññā means perception, not awareness.
11. And not with awareness destroyed (na vibhūtasaññī). Saññī
must again mean awareness not perception. Because destruction of perception is a meditation state that only arahants attain
(Sn.v.1113; A.5.325).
12. For one arriving at this, material form is annihilated. This
seems to contradict D.1.223 where the Buddha said one should
not ask where the material elements are annihilated (aparisesā
nirujjhanti). Rather, one should ask where they ﬁnd no footing
(na gādhati). Perhaps ‘annihilation of material form’ means the
death of the arahant where no further body is taken up (S.4.60).
‘Finding no footing’ in fact refers to viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ anantaṃ sabbato pahaṃ, which is the mind of the living arahant. See:
What is the consciousness of an arahant? page 139.
13. Fictitious perceptions are indeed the source of the notion of
‘me’: perhaps the Buddha added this comment to emphasise that
the notion of ‘me’ is what sustains material form, because the
notion of ‘me’ is linked to re-birth. One who overcomes the noTEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

11. QUARRELS AND DISPUTES

tion of ‘me’ is free of birth, ageing and death (M.3.246) and realises Nibbāna here and now (anattasaññi asmimānasamugghātaṃ
pāpuṇāti diṭṭheva dhamme nibbānaṃ’ti) (Ud.37).
14. idha: means ‘in this world’ at v.801 also.
15. ‘the arahant’s passing away’: the suttas distinguish two elements of Nibbāna: Nibbāna with residue, and Nibbāna without
residue. The Nibbāna-element with residue (saupādisesā nibbānadhātu) means the destruction of attachment, hatred and delusion by the arahant (tassa yo rāgakkhayo dosakkhayo mohakkhayo,
ayaṃ vuccati saupādisesā nibbānadhātu). Being ‘with residue’ means
the arahant continues to experience pleasure and pain, because of
his unimpaired sense faculties – these sense faculties being called
the ‘residue’. The Nibbāna-element without residue (anupādisesā
nibbānadhātu) refers to the ﬁnal passing of the arahant, who utterly abandons all modes of being and attains the heart of the
Teaching (dhammasārādhigamā) (It.38-9).

Notes
1. Truth: dhammaṃ is here synonymous with saccaṃ in v.882.
2. ‘All of them are fools’: Each person says that other people’s
teachings are contemptible (says v.905); therefore, each person is
likely to be accused by others of having a contemptible teaching,
and so of being a fool. The Buddha says they are of ‘very little
wisdom’ because they are accused in the same terms by which
they accuse others.
3. The text reads ‘maintain their own views’. From v.796, I take
this to mean ‘maintain their own views are the highest Goal’.
4. vīvadātā: derived from odāta, which PED says is an adjective
and a past participle.
5. ‘This (my view) is Truth’: one who has realised Truth has
done so by forsaking everything (v.946). Therefore no view can
be called Truth. So a sage would ‘not proclaim of any teaching
TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

69

12. THE LESSER BLIND ALLEY

“This itself is ﬁnal puriﬁcation” ’ (v.794). Though tathiya is an adjective, it is apparently a synonym of the noun saccaṃ in the next
line.
6. So-called experts, with sophistry, call their own views ‘Truth’,
and their opponents’ views ‘Falsehood’ (v.886).
7. Fixed duality: In this verse the Buddha says Truth is eternal.
The sophists apparently agree with this. Therefore they presumably regard the duality they proclaim (dvayadhammamāhu) to be
ﬁxed.
8. ‘That “somebody else” would be of inferior wisdom also’: because ‘each person says that the others’ teachings are contemptible’
(v.905).

Notes
1. Relish (khantimakubbamāno):
Norman calls it ‘preference’ though his notes say that khantimakubbamāno is synonymous with pemaṃ akaronto. Khanti occurs in
v.944 in the parallel phrase: ‘He should not be nostalgic (nābhinandeyya) about the past / Nor relish (khantiṃ na kubbaye) what is
new’. Here khanti obviously correlates with abhinandati.
2. ‘We should train ourselves in just this, for it is puriﬁcation’:
This is an example of v.794’s concocting a religious teaching and
blindly following it.
3. Forsaken precepts and practices: see Should monks forsake
precepts and practices? page 147.
4. Abstaining from initiating new kamma, see: Is the arahant free
of kamma? page 131. In this sentence, virato care has no object.
78

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

MAHĀBYŪHA SUTTA

Because the verse is about kamma, I take it to mean ‘abstaining
from initiating new kamma’, because the same concept also occurs at v.953 (virato so viyārambhā). Norman translates virato care
as ‘he would dwell detached’, whereas in v.943 and v.953, where
there is an object, he calls virato ‘abstaining’.
5. ‘Peaceful, free of grasping’: I take santimanuggahāya to be synonymous with anuggahāya santo of v.839.
6. ‘Concocted views about existence’: pakappitā. ‘Concoct’ is related in the Octads to a variety of subjects: religious teachings
(dhammā) (v.784); views about existence (diṭṭhi bhavābhavesu)
(v.786); concepts about what is seen, heard or cognised (v.802);
opinions (vinicchayā) (v.838); sophistry (v.886); views (diṭṭhi) (v.910).
I have followed the subject suggested in the last line of the previous verse.
7. ‘True’: sacca is an adjective; saccaṃ (next verse) a noun, Truth.
8. In regards to dogmatic teachings, a Brahman has no attachment (na … atthi dhammesu niccheyya samuggahītaṃ – ‘not anything in regards to dogmatic religious teachings’): I take the ‘anything’ to mean attachment (i.e. the Brahman has no attachment)
because the phrase dhammesu niccheyya samuggahītaṃ is linked to
nivesanā (attachment) at v.801: ‘no attachment to dogmatic religious teachings’.
9. An auxiliary basis of attachment: aññena, see Translation Notes,
page 161.
10. ‘Blindly follow’: I take sāreti (sārī) to be a synonym of purakkharoti.
11. Blinding tendencies: āsavā, see Translation Notes, page 162.
12. What is the stain of the world? Verses 778-9 say possessiveness (pariggahesu) is the stain (lippatī). Verses 811-2 say lamentaTEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

79

13. THE GREATER BLIND ALLEY

tion and selﬁshness (paridevamaccharaṃ) are the stain (limpati).
13. Stained by the world (loke). Duroiselle (para 601, xiv) says
the locative case is extensively used instead of other cases. Here
I take loke as instrumental case.

Notes
1. The basis of the conception of ‘me’ (mūlaṃ papañcasaṅkhāya),
the thought ‘I am’. I take the conception of ‘me’ to be the ‘eighteen thoughts associated with clinging’ (aṭṭhārasa taṇhāvicaritāni).
The Buddha said when there is the thought ‘I am’ (asmīti sati),
there comes seventeen other thoughts: ‘I am in this world’ (itthasmīti hoti); ‘I am thus’; ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am bad’; ‘I am good’;
‘I might be’; ‘I might be in this world’; ‘I might be thus’; ‘I might

be otherwise’; ‘may I be’; ‘may I be in this world’; ‘may I be thus’;
‘may I be otherwise’; ‘I will be’; ‘I will be in this world’; ‘I will be
thus’; ‘I will be otherwise’ (A.2.212-3).
2. See Translation Notes: papañcasaṅkhāya, page 170; taṇhā, page
164; sato, page 173.
3. ‘A cause of obstinacy’: The Buddha said that obstinately holding onto one’s own views (thāmasā parāmassa abhinivissa) leads to
clashes with people of diﬀerent views. Forseeing this trouble for
oneself, one would forsake whatever views one is obstinately attached to and not cling to any others (M.1.498).
4. ‘Extinguishing’: I take nibbutiṃ as referring to the illusion of
Self, because v.783 says that a peaceful monk has completely extinguished the illusion of Self (abhinibbutatto)

Notes
1. ‘Nor falls away’: Sīdati seems synonymous with avokkamma in
v.946, meaning ‘not falling away from Truth’.
2. ‘Concocted religious teachings’ (pakappanaṃ): ‘concoct’ is related in the Octads to a variety of objects: views about existence
(diṭṭhi bhavābhavesu) (v.786); religious teachings (dhammā) (v.784);
ﬁctitious perceptions (v.802); opinions (vinicchayā) (v.838); views
(diṭṭhi) (v.910). The simile here indicates a diﬃcult attempt to
cross over greed, lust and sense pleasures. A diﬃcult foothold indicates that concocted religious teachings are being used to achieve
this.
3. ‘Stream’: called the stream of taṇhā at S.4.292.
4. ‘Does not grieve for what does not exist’, See The Octads in a
Nutshell: Abiding in solitude, page 108.

Appendix 1
THE OCTADS IN A NUTSHELL
Summary
The Octads presents diﬀerent statements on Truth and Truthﬁnding in which the words of arahants are contrasted with those
of ‘so-called experts’. In summary the advice of the Octads is this:
• detach from everything
• realise Truth
• purify yourself
• ﬁnd peace
• abide in solitude
• attain the fruits of Truth-realisation
• dispel Darkness
• desist from arguments
• develop good qualities – the ‘shoulds’

Detaching from everything
One of the prominent themes of the Group of Octads is attachment – attachment to pleasure and to views. Attachment to pleasure means that ‘if his pleasures diminish, he suﬀers as if pierced
with an arrow’ (v.767) and, for those so attached ‘when drawn
into diﬃculty, they lament: “What will become of us in the hereafter?” ’ (v.773).
105

THE OCTADS IN A NUTSHELL

Attachment to views means thinking one’s own view is
supreme in the world (v.796), and asserting that it alone is Truth
(v.832), the highest Goal (vv.788; 796). This leads to disputes
(v.796); to hard heartedness (v.780); to seeing other people as inferior (vv.798); and calling them fools (v.887).
As for detachment, in the Octads, it seems that one can only
detach from a path of virtue; one cannot detach from a path of
non-virtue. One cannot cross over the ﬂood of sorrow without
having bailed out one’s boat (v.771). This is diﬃcult to do (v.772).
It involves freeing oneself from deﬁlement, not just living physically detached in a cave (v.772). If one does not detach, one is not
easily liberated (v.773).
Detachment means abandoning merit and evil (v.790) and
detaching from ﬁctitious perceptions (v.792), from knowledge
(v.800), from aspiration for every form of existence (v.801); from
precepts and practices, and all conduct, whether ﬂawed or not
(v.900). In the Octads, these are called auxiliary bases of attachment (vv.789, 813, 908, 790).
Detaching from precepts does not mean immoral behaviour,
because the Buddha describes the supreme person as one who is
restrained in speech (v.850); not arousing contempt (v.852); who
abstains from initiating new kamma (v.900). This aspect of practice is discussed in: Should monks forsake precepts and practices? on page 147.

Realising Truth
Truth is single (v.884) and eternal (v.884); there is not another
Truth about which mankind should contend (v.884). Truth is realised through one’s own insight (sakkhidhammamanītihamadassī)
(v.934). One who has realised Truth has done so by detaching
from everything (v.946), both merit and evil, (v.790) and precepts
and practices (v.900). He hopes for nothing in the world (v.794).
106

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

Therefore he is peaceful (v.946).
But so-called experts think their own religious teachings, views
and opinions are Truth, and call them ‘sanctity’ (subhaṃ) (vv.824;
832; 904; 910) or the highest Goal (vv.833; 904). Other people’s
views they call ‘contemptible’; the sophists call them ‘Falsehood’
(musāti) (v.886).

Purifying oneself
The wise say that puriﬁcation of heart is the summit (agga) of
practice. Puriﬁcation means freedom from ﬁctitious perceptions
(v.874-6). It is to be found here in this world (v.876) - though some
so-called experts think it is found only at the ﬁnal passing away
of the khandhas (v.876).
Some so-called experts think that puriﬁcation is intrinsic to
self-restraint (v.898), or to ascetic practices (v.901). They think
that only in their own dogmatic teachings is there puriﬁcation
(v.892) and accuse people with other religious views of straying
from puriﬁcation (v.891). But the good say that these things proclaimed by so-called experts are merely auxiliary bases of attachment (v.908). As such, they cannot purify other bases of attachment (v.790). If one dedicates oneself to a basis of attachment,
one is led on to further existence (v.898).
Various ascetic practices are described in: Should monks forsake precepts and practices? on page 147.

Finding peace
Sometimes the goal is described as peace (santo). Peace is found
by scrutinising religious views without grasping them (v.837).
This peace comes from within, not from some auxiliary basis of
attachment (v.919). It comes from not clinging (v.912), from forsaking everything (vv.946; 949), from having nothing further to
relinquish (v.919), from extinguishing the illusion of Self (v.933).

107

THE OCTADS IN A NUTSHELL

Abiding in solitude
Sometimes the goal is said to be solitude (vivekā). Solitude
does not simply mean physical solitude (v.772) or faring alone
(ekacariyaṃ. It means freedom from attachment, deﬁlement and
delusion (v.772) even in the midst of sense contact (v.851). It
means freedom from passion, clinging to nothing in the world
(v.915), and seeing nothing in the world as one’s own (v.861). But
solitude also means physical solitude; for instance, not pursuing
sexual intercourse (vv.814, 820, 821), and having no children, cattle ﬁelds or property (v.858).
At S.4.37 a ‘solitary person’ (ekavihārī’ti) is one who, even when
crowded round, dwells without clinging (taṇhā). At S.2.283, the
Buddha said that spending the whole day alone is only a partial fulﬁllment of solitude (ekavihārī). For complete fulﬁlment
(vitthāreṇa paripuṇṇo hoti), one must abandon the past and the future and thoroughly remove longing and greed for the present
forms of individual existence (yaṃ atītaṃ taṃ pahīnaṃ yaṃ anāgataṃ taṃ paṭinissaṭṭhaṃ; paccuppannesu ca attabhāvapaṭilābhesu
chandarāgo suppaṭivinīto).

Attaining the fruits of Truth-realisation
The good qualities that Truth-realisation brings are these: no illusion of Self (v.783); no boasting of one’s virtue (v.783); no conceit (v.783); seeing things as they are (v.793); conducting oneself
openly (v.793); not hungering for existence (v.839); being untethered, unattached, not possessive (vv.839; 849; 851); being free of
false desire and yearning (vv.849; 856); being free of strong emotions (vv.850; 852); being well behaved in body, speech and mind
(vv.850; 852; 853); being free of sorrow (v.851); being not guided
by ﬁxed views (v.851); not getting involved in arguments (vv.859;
912); not comparing oneself with others (vv.855; 860); being in108

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

diﬀerent to pleasure (v.857); being free of time (v.860); not concocting religious teachings nor blindly following them (v.861).

Dispelling Darkness
Darkness is that which should be dispelled (vinodayeyya), or
put an end to (vihane). Having done this, one attains delight
(ratimajjhagā). Darkness has many aspects, one of which is a disturbed mind (āvilattaṃ manaso). A disturbed mind should be
dispelled, by recognising that it is part of Darkness. But some
aspects of Darkness must be dispelled with a composed mind
(ekodibhūto), by examining the Buddha’s teachings at suitable
times, in suitable ways (vv.956, 967, 975).

Desisting from arguments
Sages do not enter arguments or speak to people contentiously
(vv.780; 844) because they do not cling to any view (v.787). They
do not take sides in a dispute (v.800). They do not pit one
view against another, or grasp any view as the highest Goal
(paramuggahītaṃ). Having abandoned ﬁxed opinions, they create
no more trouble in the world (v.894). They regard non-dispute as
the grounds for peace (v.896).
But people who say that their own view is the highest Goal, and
call other views are contemptible, have not gone beyond disputes
(v.796). Such people proclaim that purity is intrinsic to their religious teachings alone (v.824). They go looking for arguments,
seeking praise, considering other people fools (v.825). If they lose
an argument, they are shaken by the criticism (v.826) and wail
about their defeat (v.827). The victor, however, gets puﬀed up
with pride. This is the basis of later distress (v.830). Seeing this,
one should desist from arguments because it does not lead to purity (v.830).

THE OCTADS IN A NUTSHELL

Developing good qualities – the ‘shoulds’
Of the Octads’ one hundred and twenty-two ‘shoulds’, eightytwo are packed into the last three discourses, giving these discourses a distinctive tone. These ‘shoulds’ are the views that v.837
says should be scrutinised without grasping. They occur as:
• an answer to a request to ‘speak about the path of practice,
about monastic discipline, and also about samadhi’ (v.921);
• a recitation of the training rules (v.940);
• as an answer to Venerable Sāriputta’s question: ‘For a monk
going where he never before has gone … What should be
the manner of his speech? What should be his ﬁeld of conduct? What should be that energetic monk’s precepts and
practices?’
Although these ‘shoulds’ are to be pursued, they are not to be
made objects of pride (v.822, v.846). If they are grasped, one will
be simply led onto further existence (v.898).

Appendix 2
GOAL AND PATH: WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP?
Some religions proclaim a ﬁnal goal that is lower than the Buddhist Nibbāna. Indeed, what some ascetics proclaim as the ﬁnal
goal, is often merely a stage on the Buddhist path. For instance,
some proclaim ‘ultimate puriﬁcation’ lies in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception (A.5.64). It was on the basis
of this that the Buddha’s teacher Uddaka Rāmaputta proclaimed
himself a ‘knowledge-master’ and a ‘universal conqueror’ (S.4.83;
M.1.165). Others say that Nibbāna is found in the practice of jhāna
(D.1.37-8); or proclaim that the highest austerity lies in suﬀusing
the world with a mind of compassion and serenity (D.3.50). This
confusion about what constitutes the goal is one of the sources of
quarrels in the Octads.
The Buddha said that the highest Nibbāna is liberation free
of ownership (anupādā vimokkho) (A.5.64). He said that this Nibbāna exists (tiṭṭhateva nibbānaṃ); the path to it exists (tiṭṭhati nibbānagāmimaggo); and he said that he was the guide (samādapetā).
When his disciples have been instructed by him, some attain
this ultimate goal, some do not. The Buddha explained: ‘What
can I do about it? A Tathāgata is the proclaimer of the path’
(maggakkhāyīhaṃ tathāgato’ti) (M.3.6). So he was not proclaiming
Truth. The confusion between the path and goal is another source
of quarrels in the Octads.
The relationship between path and goal is explained in several
suttas. When someone visited Venerable Ānanda in Ghosita’s
monastery Venerable Ānanda told him that the goal of the holy
life is to abandon longing (chando); and to abandon longing, one
must long to do so. When one has achieved the goal, the longing
ceases: the longing for arahantship ceases at arahantship. To il111

GOAL AND PATH: WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP?

lustrate this, Ānanda asked his visitor if he had earlier longed to
visit the monastery. Of course, the man said yes. Then, when arrived, did the longing subside? Again the man said yes (S.5.272).
Similarly, the Buddha compared his teachings to a raft for
crossing a stream from a danger to safety. Having crossed, one
might reﬂect on how useful the raft has been; but one should then
abandon it. It would be absurd to carry it around on one’s head.
The Buddha said his teachings likewise were for crossing over,
not for grasping. He concluded: ‘When you see that religious
teachings are similar to a raft, you should abandon even what
is righteous, how much more so things which are unrighteous
(dhammāpi vo pahātabbā pageva adhammā) (M.1.135).
Similarly, Venerable Puṇṇa said that the stages of the spiritual
path were like a relay of chariots. The only purpose of each stage
is to reach the next stage.
• Purifying virtue
• is to purify the mind
• which is to purify one’s views
• which is to overcome uncertainty
• which is to attain knowledge and vision of what is the path
and what is not
• which is to attain knowledge and vision of the practice
• which is to attain knowledge and vision
• which is to attain ﬁnal Nibbāna without clinging.
Each of the intermediate stages is eventually abandoned. But
each stage must be attained before its abandonment. As Venerable Puṇṇa explained: if ﬁnal Nibbāna could be attained without
112

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

the intermediate stages, then an ordinary person would attain
Nibbāna, because he is without these stages (M.1.149-150).
The three similes illustrate diﬀerent aspects of liberation:
• the simile of walking to a park shows that one’s spiritual
eﬀorts are abandoned;
• the simile of the raft shows that the Buddha’s teachings are
abandoned;
• the simile of the relay chariots shows that one’s attainments
on the path are abandoned.

Appendix 3
DO ARAHANTS THINK ‘I AM’?
It is by taking possession of the ﬁve khandhas that the presumption ‘I am’ arises (upādāya asmi’ti hoti) (S.3.105). When
one perceives not-Self one removes the presumption of a ‘me’.
This is Nibbāna here and now (anattasaññi asmimānasamugghātaṃ
pāpuṇāti diṭṭheva dhamme nibbānaṃ’ti) (Ud.37). So, for instance,
when Venerable Sāriputta entered ﬁrst jhāna he did not think
‘I attained ﬁrst jhāna’ (ahaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ samāpannoti) or ‘I
emerged from ﬁrst jhāna’ (ahaṃ paṭhamā jhānā vuṭṭhitoti) (S.3.235).
Nonetheless, an arahant might say ‘I speak’ (ahaṃ vadāmī’ti)
or ‘They speak to me’ (mamaṃ vadantī’ti). Skilful, knowing
the world’s expressions, he expresses himself using everyday
language (vohāramattena so vohareyyāti) (S.1.14). Therefore, the
Buddha would ask ‘What does the Saṅgha expect of me?’
(kimpanānanda bhikkhusaṅgho mayi paccāsiṃsati) (D.2.100); or he
would exclaim ‘Ānanda, I am now old, worn out, venerable, one
who has travelled life’s path, I have reached the term of life,
which is eighty’ (ahaṃ kho panānanda etarahi jiṇṇo vuddho mahallako addhagato vayo anuppatto; āsītiko me vayo vattati) (D.2.100). He
even said ‘All-conquering, am I: all things do I know’ (sabbābhibhu
sabbavidu’hamasmi) (Dhp.353). And he claimed ‘I am perfected in
the world; I am the supreme teacher; I alone am completely awakened; I am become cool, and attained Nibbāna’ (ahaṃ hi arahā loke
ahaṃ satthā anuttaro, eko’mhi sammāsambuddho sītibhutosmi nibbuto)
(Vin.1.8). But this are expressions in everyday language, which
the Tathāgata uses ‘without grasping’ (lokasamaññā lokaniruttiyo lokavohārā lokapaññattiyo yāhi tathāgato voharati aparāmasanti)
(D.1.202); and aparāmasanti implies that one does not see things
as ‘me’ or ‘mine’ or ‘my Self’ (S.2.94). These statements are not
115

DO ARAHANTS THINK ‘I AM’?

the expression of conceit or ignorance. A monk whose mind is
liberated employs the usual way of speech in the world without adhering to it (yañca loke vuttaṃ teneva voharati aparāmasanti)
(M.1.501).

116

Appendix 4
DO ARAHANTS COMPARE THEMSELVES?
The Buddha described three modes of thought (tisso vidhā):
• ‘I am superior’-mode seyyohamasmī’ti vidhā
• ‘I am equal’-mode sadisohamasmī’ti vidhā
• ‘I am inferior’-mode hīnohamasmī’ti vidhā
He said the noble eightfold path is to be developed for the realisation of these three modes, for the full understanding of them,
for their destruction and abandonment (S.5.56).
He said, if anyone regards himself as superior, equal or inferior
(seyyohamasmīti vā samanupassanti, sadisohamasmīti vā samanupassanti, hīnohamasmīti vā samanupassanti) on the basis of the impermanent, sorrowful, changing ﬁve khandhas, that it is due to not
seeing things as they really are (yathābhūtassa adassanā). Not regarding oneself thus (na samanupassanti) is due to seeing things
as they really are (yathābhutassa dassanā) (S.3.48).
The Octads says that the Buddha did not ‘suppose that he [was]
either inferior or superior’ (v.799). If he supposed himself to be
equal, superior or inferior, he ‘would contend with others because of it. But for one who is untroubled by these three modes of
thought there is nobody equal, superior or inferior’ (vv.842; 918).
Nor did the Buddha regard other religious teachers as inferior,
because ‘the good call that thing a bond, if, tethered to it, one regards other people as inferior. Therefore a monk should not be
tethered to what is seen, heard, or cognised, nor to precepts and
practices’ (v.797).
The arahant Venerable Khema agreed with this. He said that
an arahant would not think ‘Someone is better than me; someone
117

DO ARAHANTS COMPARE THEMSELVES?

is equal; someone is worse’ (tassa na evaṃ hoti atthi me seyyoti vā
atthi me sadisoti vā atthi me hīnoti vā’ti). Similarly, the arahant Venerable Sumana said that an arahant would not think ‘No one is
better than me; no one is equal; no one is worse’ (tassa na evaṃ
hoti ‘natthi me seyyoti vā, natthi me sadisoti vā, natthi me hīnoti vā’ti)
(A.3.359).
Nonetheless, the Buddha called himself ‘unique, without peer,
without counterpart; incomparable; unequalled; matchless; unrivalled; best of men (adutiyo asahāyo, appaṭimo, appaṭisamo, appaṭibhāgo, appaṭipuggalo, asamo asamasamo, dipadānaṃ aggo) (A.1.22)
and said he was the most excellent of speakers (buddho pavadataṃ
varoti) (S.1.42). He said: ‘I do not see (na kho panāhaṃ passāmi)
any other recluse or brahman (aññaṃ samaṇaṃ vā brāhmaṇaṃ)
more perfect in virtue than myself, nor in concentration, wisdom, release, whom I could dwell reverencing, obeying and serving’ (sīlasampannataraṃ yamahaṃ … samādhi sampannataraṃ …
paññāsampannataraṃ … vimuttisampannataraṃ) (A.2.20; D.1.174).
He said: ‘Among all the teachers now existing in the world, I see
none who has attained to such a position of fame and following
as I have’ (yāvatā kho cunda etarahi satthāro loke uppannā, nāhaṃ
cunda aññaṃ ekasatthārampi samanussami evaṃ lābhaggayasaggappattaṃ yatharivāhaṃ) (D.3.126). He told Brahma Baka that ‘in
regard to special knowledge, I am not equal to you, nor lower;
rather, I know more than you (neva te samasamo abhiññāya, kuto
nīceyyaṃ, atha kho ahameva tayā bhiyyo) (M.1.329).
The Buddha also compared others. He called Venerable
Sāriputta ‘chief (aggaṃ) amongst those of great wisdom’ and
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna ‘chief among those of supernormal
powers’ (A.1.23). He said, ‘I know not of any other person who
so perfectly keeps rolling the wheel of Dhamma set rolling by
the Tathāgata as does Sāriputta’ (A.1.23). Conversely, he said
‘Monks, I know not of any other single person fraught with such
loss to many folk … as Makkhali, that foolish man’ (makkhalī
118

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

moghapuriso) (A.1.33).
Venerable Sāriputta likewise favoured the Buddha. He said
that it was clear to him that there never has been, never will be,
and is not now, another ascetic or brahman who is better or more
enlightened than the Buddha (bhiyyobhiññataro yadidaṃ sambodhiyanti) (D.3.103).
So we must understand Venerables Khema’s and Sumana’s
statements to mean that although arahants compare themselves,
it is not in personal terms. Even though they might talk in personal terms, it would not be from ignorance. No Self-view would
be involved. The Buddha’s claims were not from arrogance or
conceit. Therefore he would never ignorantly exalt himself and
disparage others (na attānukkaṃseti na paraṃ vambheti). He would
never say ‘I live knowing and seeing, but these other people live
unknowing and unseeing’ (ahamasmi jānaṃ passaṃ viharāmi, ime
panaññe bhikkhū ajānaṃ apassaṃ viharantīti) (M.1.195). Nor would
he think ‘I am well known and famous; but these other people are
unknown and powerless’ (ahaṃ khomhi ñāto yasassasī. Ime panaññe
bhikkhū appaññātā appesakkhā’ti) (M.3.38).

Appendix 5
DID THE BUDDHA THINK BUDDHISM WAS THE
BEST?
The Buddha saw his own teaching as endowed with all good
qualities (sabbākārasampannaṃ) and said that if anyone thought it
could be improved by adding or subtracting from it, it would because of not truly seeing it (D.3.127). He said the schools of other
sects were devoid of true ascetics (suññā parappavādā samaṇehi
aññe) (D.2.151). He said a monk should train himself in solitude
because it is the supreme training (etadariyānamuttamaṃ) (Octads,
v.822). Regarding people who speculate about the future and
the past, the Buddha did not consider their theories equal to his
own, still less superior. He said ‘I am their superior in regard
to the higher exposition’ (atha kho ahameva tattha bhiyyo yadidaṃ
adhipaññatti) (D.3.139). He described the Saṅgha of his disciples as the unsurpassed ﬁeld of merit for the world (bhagavato
sāvakasaṅgho … anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassāti) (M.1.37). Venerable Sāriputta agreed; he said that the Buddha’s way of teaching Dhamma in regards to wholesome states is unsurpassed
(etadānuttariyaṃ yathā bhagavā dhammaṃ deseti kusalesu dhammesu)
(D.3.102).
Of course these are indeed views; and, as such, they were not
grasped by the Buddha. This is a common theme of the Octads,
for instance in the Māgandiya Sutta: ‘[The wise] do not say that
purity is intrinsic to views, learning, knowledge, or precepts and
practices; nor intrinsic to a lack of views, learning, knowledge,
precepts and practices. But by detaching from these, not grasping
them, at peace, untethered, one no longer hungers for existence’
(v.839).
Once, the Buddha gave three reﬂections, which he called
121

DID THE BUDDHA THINK BUDDHISM WAS THE BEST?

views:
• This has come to be (bhūtamidanti)
• Its origin occurs with that as nutriment (tadāhārasambhavanti)
• With the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be
is subject to cessation (tadāhāranirodhā yaṃ bhūtaṃ taṃ nirodhadhammanti)
Then he told the monks that, as puriﬁed and bright as these
views (diṭṭhiṃ) are, if the monks adhered to them, cherished
them, treated them as a possession, they would have failed to understand that Dhamma is like a raft, for the purpose of crossing
over, not for the purpose of grasping (M.1.260).
Similarly, the Brahmajāla Sutta says that although the Buddha
knew (pajānāti) what the result of grasping views (diṭṭhiṭṭhānā
evaṃgahitā evaṃparāmaṭṭhā) is, he was not attached to that knowledge (pajānanaṃ na parāmasati) and therefore he experienced for
himself perfect peace (paccattaññeva nibbuti viditā) (D.1.16-17).
So even the view or knowledge that ‘Buddhism is best’ should
not become an object of grasping or of pride. If one is attached
to it, one will argue over religious teachings (v.787). If one thinks
of oneself as better than others because of one’s views, one will
contend with others because of it (v.842).
But if one abandons one’s ﬁxed opinions, one creates no more
trouble in the world (v.894). One remains equanimous, not grasping what other people grasp (v.912). One becomes someone who
has found peace within (v.919). One could rightfully tell Pasūra
(vv.832-834):

WHAT HAPPENS TO AN ARAHANT AT DEATH?
The Buddha said one cannot ﬁnd the ‘one whose knots are cut’
(S.1.23). He said that one who sees things as ‘not me or mine’
(neso hamasmi netaṃ me) is detached (virajjati); and being thus detached cannot be found by Māra and his army, and is secure, gone
beyond all fetters (S.1.112). He said his own body stood with the
link that bound it to becoming cut, and that as long as his present
body subsisted, devas and humans would see him, but at death,
devas and humans would see him no more (D.1.46). He would
not take possession of a new body (natthi aññañca kāyaṃ upādiyati)
(S.4.60).
Whether, after death, he continued to exist or not, the Buddha
left unexplained. When asked about it, he said ‘Consider what is
unexplained as unexplained’ – because ‘it is not connected with
the goal; it is not fundamental to the holy life; it does not lead to
liberation’ (M.1.427-432). He said that as he was not apprehended
as real and actual in this very life, it would be unﬁtting to discuss
what happens to him after death (S.3.118). He said that because
he was liberated from the ﬁve aggregates, he was unfathomable
(S.4.377).
The suttas distinguish two elements of Nibbāna: Nibbāna with
residue, and Nibbāna without residue. The Nibbāna-element
with residue (saupādisesā nibbānadhātu) means the destruction of
greed, hatred and delusion by the arahant (tassa yo rāgakkhayo
dosakkhayo mohakkhayo ayaṃ vuccati saupādisesā nibbānadhātu). Being ‘with residue’ means the arahant has unimpaired sense faculties, and therefore continues to experience pleasure and pain.
The Nibbāna-element without residue (anupādisesā nibbānadhātu)
refers to the ﬁnal passing away of the arahant, who utterly aban125

WHAT HAPPENS TO AN ARAHANT AT DEATH?

dons all modes of being and attains ‘the heart of the Teaching’ (dhammasārādhigamā) (It.38-9). But whether it is Nibbāna
with residue, or without, Truth is single (v.884). Therefore the
Nibbāna-element, with or without residue, must be single.
But what is the Nibbāna-element? Venerable Mahākotthita
put the question like this: Is something or nothing left after
the ﬁnal destruction of the six spheres of sense contact (channaṃ
phassāyatanānaṃ asesavirāganirodhā atthaññaṃ kiñcī). Because this
question concerns the cessation of suﬀering (evametassa kevalassa
dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hotī’ti: S.2.14) it is therefore about Nibbāna. Venerable Sāriputta told Venerable Mahākotthita that to
involve oneself with such questions is to form ﬁctitious perceptions about what is beyond ﬁctitious perceptions (appapañcaṃ papañceti) (A.2.161). He said ‘However far the six spheres of contact go, that is how far ﬁctitious perceptions go. However far
ﬁctitious perceptions go, that is how far the six spheres of contact go. With the complete destruction of the six spheres of contact there is the complete destruction all ﬁctitious perceptions
(channaṃ āvuso phassāyatanānaṃ asesavirāganirodhā papañcanirodho
papañcavūpasamo’ti) (A.2.161). So when Venerable Mahākotthita
repeatedly asked him about the matter, he repeatedly replied
‘Don’t ask that, friend (māhevaṃ āvuso)’.
In contrast to Venerable Sāriputta’s apparent reluctance to discuss the matter, the Buddha was more forthcoming. He described Nibbāna as being viññāṇa without attributes, everlasting,
completely without a source (viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ, anantaṃ sabbatopabhaṃ). This is probably synonymous with the ‘unbroken
stream of viññāṇa not established either in this world or the next
(idha loke appatiṭṭhitañca paraloke appatiṭṭhitañca) (D.3.104-5). (See:
What is the consciousness of an arahant? page 139.). He said that
people entering Nibbāna were like streams and showers that enter the ocean without aﬀecting the ocean’s fullness or depletion.
In the same way, even if many monks attain the Nibbāna-element
126

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

(anupādisesāya nibbānadhātuyā parinibbāyanti), it in no way aﬀects
the fullness or depletion of the Nibbāna element (na tena nibbānadhātuyā ūnattaṃ vā pūrattaṃ vā paññāyati) (Vin.2.239). He also
described Nibbāna in poetry:
Where neither water nor yet earth
Nor ﬁre nor air gain a foothold,
There gleam no stars, no sun sheds light,
There shines no moon, yet there no darkness reigns.
When a sage, a brahman, has come to know this
For himself through his own wisdom,
Then he is freed from form and formless.
Freed from pleasure and from pain.
(Tr.Ireland; Ud.9)
On a diﬀerent occasion, Venerable Sāriputta, though aloof
with Venerable Mahākotthita, chose a more encouraging attitude with Venerable Udāyin. He told him that Nibbāna
is happiness (sukhamidaṃ āvuso nibbānan’ti) and said that by
‘Nibbāna’, he meant the ending of perception and feeling
(saññāvedayitanirodhaṃ). This is a meditation state achieved after attaining the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception
and is a state consistently associated with the destruction of the
āsavās by seeing them with wisdom (paññāya cassa disvā āsavā
parikkhīṇā honti) which is arahantship. And the happiness found
there is the happiness where nothing is sensed (sukhaṃ yadettha
natthi vedayitaṃ) (A.4.414). The Buddha conﬁrmed this, describing the state as a happiness more excellent and sublime than any
other state (S.4.228). And this highest happiness, he also called
Nibbāna (nibbāṇaparamaṃ sukhaṃ) (Dh.v.203). Venerable Anuruddha’s statements support this. He said he saw no abiding
higher or more sublime than the ending of perception and feeling, and the Buddha supported this statement (M.1.209).

WHAT HAPPENS TO AN ARAHANT AT DEATH?

Given that it involves absence of sensation, it is perplexing that
one can make any statement at all about the ending of perception and feeling, that one can retain any memory of it, that one
would know it is everlasting, and recognise that it is completely
without a source. It is even surprising that arahants attaining
the ending of perception and feeling are able to recognise and
remember that, during the experience, perception and feeling
ended (M.1.302). Although this implies some retention of consciousness, the matter is admittedly unfathomable.
Most ancient and modern commentators consider the ending of perception and feeling to be a state that is accessible to
non-returners (e.g. Visuddhimagga 702-9). By accessible, they
seem to mean that one can emerge from that state having failed
to achieve arahantship. Thus, even though the Anupada Sutta
says Venerable Sāriputta attained arahantship within that state
(M.3.28), the ancient commentary says his arahantship occurred
after emerging (MLDB note1052). But there is no evidence in
the suttas themselves that non-returners emerge from that state,
except in the Gradual Sayings III p.141, where Hare’s translation suggests that one who has attained the ending of perception
and feeling may in fact be reborn, and attain a mind made body.
In fact this sutta quotes Venerable Sāriputta as saying that for a
monk endowed with virtue, samādhi and wisdom, it is possible
that he might enter and emerge from the cessation of perception
and feeling. If he does not attain ﬁnal knowledge in his lifetime
(i.e. if he does not attain the cessation of perception and feeling in
his lifetime), he might transcend the realm of devas that are nourished on gross food and, having attained a mind-made body, it
is possible that he might enter and emerge from the cessation of
perception and feeling. This statement implies two things:
1. that a monk endowed with virtue, samādhi and wisdom
may not attain the cessation of perception and feeling in
his lifetime. In which case, he will, if he is a non-returner,
128

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

attain it having gained a mind-made body. If he is not a
non-returner, he will not attain it in that mind-made body.
2. entering and emerging from the cessation of perception and
feeling is synonymous with attaining ﬁnal knowledge.
The Pāli is this: Idhāvuso, bhikkhu sīlasampanno samādhisampanno
paññāsampanno saññāvedayitanirodhaṃ samāpajjeyya pi vuṭṭhaheyya’ pi atthetaṃ ṭhānaṃ. No ce diṭṭheva dhamme aññaṃ ārādheyya, atikkammeva kabaliṅkārāhārabhakkhānaṃ devānaṃ sahavyataṃ
aññataraṃ manomayaṃ kāyaṃ upapanno saññāvedayitanirodhaṃ
samāpajjeyya’pi vuṭṭhaheyya’pi atthetaṃ ṭhānanti (A.3.193).
For the living arahant, although arahantship is permanent,
and the destruction of greed, hatred and delusion is permanent, attaining the state of Nibbāna is not permanent (A.4.423-6;
M.1.302). And neither attaining it nor leaving it involve conscious
decisions. Rather, one’s mind must be developed in such a way
that it leads one into it and out of it (M.1.302). But, contradicting
this, Venerable Anuruddha said he could enter it at will (M.1.209)
– as did the Buddha and Venerable Mahākassapa (S.2.212). The
mental development that leads one into this state is presumably
the destruction of greed, hatred and delusion (tassa yo rāgakkhayo
dosakkhayo mohakkhayo) – the usual deﬁnition of Nibbāna. It is
perplexing that the destruction of these three states is itself called
Nibbāna (It.38-9), when Nibbāna seems in fact to be the cessation
of perception and feeling.
By Venerable Sāriputta’s description, attaining the ending of
perception and feeling would be rare for arahants, because many
arahants cannot even attain the preliminary step: the sphere of
neither perception nor non-perception. The Buddha was once in
a group of ﬁve hundred arahants, and said that only sixty of them
had attained the formless spheres (S.1.191). So, experiencing the
ending of perception and feeling would seem rare for arahants.
Nonetheless, because Venerable Sāriputta called this state ‘NibTEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

129

WHAT HAPPENS TO AN ARAHANT AT DEATH?

bāna’, most monks must attain it without needing to attain any
of the formless spheres. It is strictly speaking incorrect to say
‘a non-returner gains that state’, because non-returnership can
only be judged at death. If someone attains arahantship in his
lifetime, then during that period before arahantship he cannot
strictly be called a non-returner. However, the term is used in
this way as a matter of convenience. The same principle would
apply to stream-enterers, and other stages of sainthood.
But even if an arahant attains Nibbāna, as long as he remains alive, he continues to experience pleasure and pain
(sukhadukkhaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti). Perhaps he periodically re-enters
Nibbāna, either at will or when his mind leads him into it. When
he ﬁnally passes away, he attains what the Buddha called ‘the
heart of the Teaching’ (dhammasārādhigamā) (It.38-9). Because
Truth is single, one assumes that ‘the heart of the Teaching’ is
that same unparallelled happiness – the happiness that is everlasting.

Appendix 7
IS THE ARAHANT FREE OF KAMMA?
Verse 953 says that an arahant:
• has no accumulation of kamma (natthi kāci nisaṅkhiti).
• abstains from initiating new kamma (virato so viyārambhā).
These statements need qualifying. To understand the kamma
of arahants, it would be helpful to review the Buddha’s teachings
on kamma.
Kamma is of four types:
• black kamma with black results: acts from unskilful roots
• white kamma with white results: acts from skilful roots
• black-and-white kamma with black-and-white results: acts
from mixed roots
• neither-black-nor-white kamma with neither-black-norwhite results: kamma that leads to the destruction of
kamma (kammakkhayāya saṃvattati) (A.2.231; A.3.338-9).
Kamma is whatever the person’s aim (cetanā) that produces
various acts of body speech and mind (cetanāhaṃ bhikkhave
kammaṃ vadāmi; cetayitvā kammaṃ karoti kāyena vācāya manasā).
Aims arise from skilful or unskilful roots: greed/non-greed, hatred/non-hatred, delusion/non-delusion. All acts, whether skilful or unskilful, are kammically potent as long as greed, hatred
and delusion are undestroyed. These kammically potent acts
ripen (vipaccati) and in due course bear fruit that must be experienced (vipākaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti) either in this life or some future
131

IS THE ARAHANT FREE OF KAMMA?

life. Such acts are compared to undamaged seeds that inevitably
produce fruit (A.1.135).
The fruit of kamma is called vipāka; or kammānaṃ upacitānaṃ
(stored-up kamma) or sometimes simply kamma. This kamma is
experienced in any of the realms of existence: hell realms, animal
realms, ghost realms, human realms, heavenly realms (A.3.414).
Acts from unskilful roots lead to lower rebirths; acts from skilful
roots lead to higher realms. An arahant does not make kamma
because, even though his acts arise from skilful roots, there is no
residual greed, hatred and delusion; therefore his acts are inoperative.
The kamma that leads to the destruction of kamma is variously
named as:
• the eightfold path (A.2.237)
• the seven factors of awakening (A.2.237)
• the aim to forsake all kamma, whether black or white
(pahānāya yā cetanā) (A.2.232)
Old kamma is not destroyed except by experiencing the result
(appaṭisaṃveditvā), either in this life, or some future life (A.5.299).
So any monk wanting to destroy his kamma, can do it in only one
way, as follows:
• For a monk who scrupulously observes the Pātimokkha
precepts: he must make no new kamma (navañca kammaṃ
na karoti), and must destroy old kamma by repeated contact
with it (purāṇañca kammaṃ phussa phussa byantīkaroti).
• For a monk who practices the jhānas: he must make no new
kamma, and must destroy old kamma by repeated contact
with it.
132

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

• For a monk with blinding tendencies destroyed (āsavānaṃ
khayā): he must make no new kamma, and must destroy old
kamma by repeated contact with it. (A.1.221).
This destruction of kamma by experiencing its results is illustrated by the monk who was sitting cross-legged not far from
the Buddha, attentive and fully conscious, enduring feelings that
were painful and sharp, the result of former unskilful kamma
(purāṇakammavipākajaṃ dukkhaṃ) (Ud.21). In the same way, skilful kamma must presumably also be destroyed by experiencing
its result.
There is no disagreement in the suttas that an arahant abstains
from initiating new kamma – either positive, negative or neutral (puññābhisaṅkhāraṃ vā abhisaṅkhareyya apuññābhisaṅkhāraṃ vā
abhisaṅkhareyya āneñjābhisaṅkhāraṃ vā abhisaṅkhareyyā’ti) (S.2.83).
This is because, after the ﬁnal destruction of greed, hatred and
delusion at arahantship, any kamma performed with non-greed,
non-hatred and non-delusion is not destined for future arising
(anuppādadhammaṃ) (A.1.135). Such acts are compared to seeds
that are destroyed, incapable of producing fruit (A.1.135). Because arahants have destroyed greed, hatred and delusion (S.5.8),
they therefore cannot make kamma.
Many suttas agree that an arahant has no accumulated kamma.
For instance, the arahant Venerable Ugga said that whatever
kamma he had created, whether small or great, ‘all that is destroyed’ (sabbametaṃ parikkhīṇaṃ) (Th.80). This implies, say the
suttas, that he had experienced its fruit (A.5.299). The suttas
say that he must have experienced all the fruit, because ‘there
is no end to dukkha, until the fruit has been experienced’ (na
tvevāhaṃ bhikkhave sañcetanikānaṃ kammānaṃ katānaṃ upacitānaṃ
appaṭisaṃveditvā dukkhassantakiriyaṃ vadāmi) (A.5.299). Although
‘the end of dukkha’ usually implies arahantship (antamakāsi
dukkhassa: A.1.134), we will review this assumption below. But,
TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

133

IS THE ARAHANT FREE OF KAMMA?

nonetheless, this phrase suggests that the arahant has indeed no
accumulated kamma.
However, all arahants have certain aspects of old kamma that
have not been destroyed. For instance, the support one receives
as a monk is related to the alms one has given in previous lives
(A.3.33-4). And the Buddha even described one’s own body and
senses as old kamma (purāṇam kammaṃ) something to be felt
(vedayitaṃ) (S.2.64; S.4.132). ‘Something to be felt’ implies that
it is puriﬁed in the same way as other kamma. This idea is illustrated in the Lakkhana Sutta, where the Buddha explained the
kamma which led to his own ﬁne body, good health and bountiful support. Presumably there are similar reasons for an arahant
having an unattractive body and poor health. This would seem
to be kamma – either good or bad – that is in the process of being
destroyed by an arahant.
Secondly, some suttas suggest that the arahant is still paying oﬀ
his old debts. For instance – as noted above – an arahant must apparently destroy old kamma by repeated contact with it (A.1.221);
which suggests that an arahant still has kamma to destroy.
Several suttas describe the situation in a mixed way. They say
that an arahant has destroyed kamma but is nonetheless still destroying it; for instance the monk who was sitting cross-legged
not far from the Buddha, attentive and fully conscious, enduring feelings that were painful and sharp, the result of former
kamma. The Buddha described him as one who had ‘forsaken
all kamma’ (sabbakammajahassa bhikkhuno) but added that he was
‘shaking oﬀ the dust of former kamma’ (dhunamānassa pure kataṃ
rajaṃ) (Ud.21). Secondly, when Venerable Angulimāla was physically attacked on almsround, the Buddha said ‘Bear it, Brahman!
Bear it, Brahman! You are experiencing here and now the result of
kamma because of which you might have been tortured in hell for
many years’ (adhivāsehi tvaṃ brāhmaṇa adhivāsehi tvaṃ brāhmaṇa;
yassa kho tvaṃ brāhmaṇa kammassa vipākena bahūni vassāni … niraye
134

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

pacceyyāsi tassa tvaṃ brāhmaṇa kammassa vipākaṃ diṭṭheva dhamme
paṭisaṃvedesī’ti) (M.2.106). The word ‘Brahman’ suggests that Angulimāla was already an arahant, but still having to bear his old
kamma. But later, in solitude he exclaimed that all his kamma
‘has touched me now’ (phuṭṭho kammavipākena) and that now ate
his almsfood ‘free of debt’ (aṇaṇo bhuñjāmi bhojanaṃ) (M.2.104-5).
The answer to this conundrum is suggested by the arahant
Venerable Samitigutta who said that whatever kamma he had
done in previous lives, ‘that must be experienced in this world’
(idheva taṃ vedanīyaṃ) because ‘there is no other basis’; which
means that for him there was no other lifetime (vatthu aññaṃ na
vijjatī’ti) (Th.81); because at the moment of enlightenment, the
arahant knows that this is his last birth, there will be no continuation of existence (ayamantimā jāti natthi dāni punabbhavo’ti).
Therefore he knows that all his kamma must be destroyed by him
within his lifetime. To that extent one can say that there is no end
to dukkha until all one’s accumulated kamma has been experienced, if by ‘the end of dukkha’ one does not mean the moment of
arahantship, but the ﬁnal passing away of the arahant, when the
body and the senses – all of it old kamma – is ﬁnally discarded.
A similar knowledge is known to non-returners who apparently know that whatever evil deeds (pāpakammaṃ) they did, the
results will be experienced in their present life (sabbaṃ taṃ idha
vedaniyaṃ); it will not follow them on (na taṃ anugaṃ bhavissatī’ti)
(A.5.301). That leaves them the fruit of good deeds to be experienced in their next (celestial) existence.

Appendix 8
DO ARAHANTS BLAME THEMSELVES?
The Buddha said a sage does not blame himself (anattagarahī)
(v.913). This is probably because ‘a wise person does nothing
for which he would blame himself’ (yadattagarahī tadakubbamāno)
(v.778). The term anattagarahī is therefore related to chinnakukkuccaṃ (freedom from remorse), which is said to be a quality of an
arahant at M.1.108. Remorse is what monks feel when they break
their precepts (S.3.120). It is linked to both vippaṭisāro (regret) and
attā sīlato upavadatī’ti (reproaching oneself in regard to virtue) and
is allayed by the training in virtue.
Sages who do something blameworthy would likely blame
themselves, because even the Buddha would blame them. For
instance, when the arahant Venerable Piṇḍolabhāradvāja publically exhibited his supernormal powers, the Buddha blamed
him (vigarahī) (Vin.2.112). It is part of the monks’ life to admonish others and accept admonishment in return (vattā ca assasi vacanakkhamo cā) (S.2.282). And monks are indeed supposed to
ask themselves whether they or their companions would blame
(upavadati) them for their conduct (A.5.88). And when being reproved, the Buddha told Venerable Sāriputta that a monk should
welcome it (v.973).

137

Appendix 9
WHAT IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN
ARAHANT?
The three viññāṇas
The scriptures describe three types of viññāṇa:
• viññāṇakkhandha
• a viññāṇa that is dependent
• a viññāṇa that is not dependent
These three viññāṇas were all included when Venerable Sāriputta told Anāthapindika to train himself by reﬂecting on viññāṇakkhandha: ‘I will not take possession of
viññāṇa[kkhanda]; my [dependent] viññāṇa will become not
dependent on viññāṇakkhandha’ (na viññāṇaṃ upādiyissāmi; na
ca me viññāṇanissitaṃ viññāṇaṃ bhavissatī’ti) (M.3.260). From
this it seems that not-dependent viññāṇa arises from dependent
viññāṇa.

Viññāṇakkhandha
The viññāṇa of viññāṇakkhandha is called ‘viññāṇa’ because, due to
it, ‘one knows’ (vijānāti) diﬀerent sensations, for example: sour,
bitter, pungent, sweet, sharp, mild, salty, bland (S.3.87). This
viññāṇa is sixfold, where each of the six viññāṇas are named
according to the sense-base from which it arises: eye-viññāṇa,
ear-viññāṇa, nose-viññāṇa, tongue-viññāṇa, body-viññāṇa and
mind-viññāṇa (M.1.259; S.3.61). Because this type of viññāṇa
is abandoned at arahantship, an arahant cannot be reckoned in
139

WHAT IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN ARAHANT?

terms of it (viññāṇasaṅkhāvimutto) (M.1.488). This viññāṇa therefore seems to be the ‘making known’ that arises when internal
sense bases (e.g. the eye) interacts with the external sense-bases
(e.g. visible forms). If so, then this viññāṇa could be called the
‘conscious function’; or simply called ‘making known’.

Dependent-type viññāṇa: the ‘stream of attachment’
or the ‘stream of me’
Venerable Sāriputta’s advice above assumed the existence
of a dependent-type viññāṇa (nissitaṃ viññāṇaṃ). Venerable
Mahākaccāna describes a similar viññāṇa in a discussion with
the householder Hāliddakāni, where he used the term ‘consciousness passionately bound to the khandhas’ as a synonym of
desire and clinging for the khandhas (S.3.10).1 This dependenttype viññāṇa may be equivalent to the rarely mentioned ‘unbroken stream of viññāṇa that is established in both this world
and the next’ (viññāṇasotaṃ abbocchinnaṃ idha loke patiṭṭhitaṃ
ca paraloke patiṭṭhitaṃ ca) (D.3.105). As we have seen, Venerable Sāriputta called it simply viññāṇa. But this ‘viññāṇa’ may
be a term for attachment itself, for instance when it is used
as Venerable Mahākaccāna used it. This would mean that the
term ‘unbroken stream of viññāṇa’ simply means the ‘unbroken stream of attachment’. If this is the case, it might also be
called ‘unbroken stream of ‘me’ and ‘mine”, a stream that ends
at arahantship (asmimānasamugghātaṃ pāpuṇāti diṭṭheva dhamme
nibbānaṃ’ti: Ud.37). This type of viññāṇa is obviously unknown
by arahants.
1 Rūpadhāturāgavinibaddhañca pana viññāṇaṃ (one whose consciousness is passionately bound to the form element) is a synonym of rūpadhātuyā kho yo chando
yo rāgo yā nandi yā taṇhā ye upayūpādānā cetaso adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā (the desire, passion, delight, clinging, the engagement and attachment, the mental standpoints, clinging, and inclination regarding the form element).

140

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

In the course of rebirth (punabbhavābhinibbatti) the dependenttype viññāṇa (or, the unbroken stream of attachment) is grounded
(patiṭṭhitaṃ) in the worlds of sense desire (kāmadhātu), or in the
worlds of form (rūpadhātu), or in the excellent worlds (paṇītāya
dhātuyā) – a process called ‘becoming’ (bhavo) (A.1.222). This
dependent-type viññāṇa is one of the four nutriments, and it
is a condition for the production of future renewed existence
(viññāṇāhāro āyatiṃ punabbhavābhinibbattiyā paccayo) (S.2.13). The
source of this stream of viññāṇa is said to be taṇhā (taṇhānidānā,
taṇhāsamudayā) (S.2.12); but sometimes it is said to be one’s intentions, plans and tendencies (yañca ceteti yañca pakappeti yañca
anuseti) (S.2.65). If ‘watered with delight’ (nandūpasecanaṃ) the
stream of viññāṇa grows and proliferates (vuddhiṃ virūḷhiṃ vepullaṃ āpajjeyya) (S.3.53). When it is established and come to growth,
the body and mind arises (nāmarūpassa avakkanti). This leads
to formation of kamma (saṅkhārānaṃ vuddhi) and the production of future renewed existence (āyatiṃ punabbhavābhinibbatti)
(S.2.101-4). If one abandons attachment to the ﬁve khandhas
(rāgo pahīno hoti) there is no basis for the dependent-type viññāna
(patiṭṭhā viññāṇassa na hoti). This may be equivalent to what the
suttas call ‘cutting the stream’ (chinnasotaṃ) (S.4.292).

Not-dependent-type viññāṇa: freedom from
attachment
At arahantship, knowledge of the second type of viññāṇa is replaced by knowledge of the third type, which could therefore
be termed ‘not-dependent-type viññāṇa’. This not-dependenttype viññāṇa may equal the rarely mentioned ‘unbroken stream
of viññāṇa not established either in this world or the next’
(viññāṇasotaṃ pajānāti ubhayato abbocchinnaṃ idha loke appatiṭṭhitañca paraloke appatiṭṭhitañca) (D.3.104-5). Venerable Sāriputta
also seemed to call this simply viññāṇa; but it may be simply a

WHAT IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN ARAHANT?

term for non-attachment itself. In which case, it could be called
‘unbroken stream of non-attachment not established either in this
world or the next’ or perhaps ‘an unbroken stream of not me-ormine not established either in this world or the next’.
The scriptures mention what is possibly another synonym:
viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ anantaṃ sabbatopabhaṃ: viññāna without
attribute, everlasting, completely without a source (M.1.329;
D.1.223). This is associated with arahantship, and is discussed
below (S.1.120-1; S.3.122-3). It seems that it is realised with the
cessation of the dependent-type viññāṇa (i.e. it is realised with
the cessation of attachment, or with the cessation of the stream
of ‘me’ and ‘mine’) (viññāṇassa nirodhena: D.1.223). This realisation occurs when one does not intend, have plans or tendencies
(S.2.66).
The liberation of viññāṇa is frequently referred to in the suttas.
Here, it is the citta that is said to be liberated:
“Having known viññāṇa[kkhanda] to be feeble, fading away, and comfortless, with the destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of
attraction and clinging regarding viññāṇa[kkhanda],
of mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying
tendencies regarding viññāṇa[kkhanda], I have understood that my mind is liberated.”
viññāṇaṃ kho ahaṃ āvuso abalaṃ virāgaṃ anassāsika’nti
viditvā ye viññāṇe upāyūpādānā cetaso adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā, tesaṃ khayā virāgā nirodhā cāgā paṭinissaggā vimuttaṃ me citta’nti pajānāmi) (M.3.31).
“When that viññāṇaṃ is unestablished, not coming to
growth, nongenerative, it is liberated. By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by
being content, he is not agitated. Being unagitated,
he personally attains Nibbāna.”

vimuttaṃ vimuttattā ṭhitaṃ, ṭhitattā santusitaṃ, santusitattā na paritassati, aparitassaṃ paccattaṃ yeva parinibbāyati (S.3.54).
With viññāṇa unestablished, the clansman Godhika
has attained ﬁnal Nibbāna: appatiṭṭhitena ca bhikkhave
viññāṇena godhiko kulaputto parinibbutoti (S.1.120-1).
When dependent-type viññāṇa becomes not-dependent-type
it does not make kamma (anabhisaṅkhacca) (i.e. freedom-fromattachment does not make kamma) and the viññāṇa is called liberated (vimuttaṃ). This means the viññāṇa is steady (ṭhitaṃ),
contented (santusitaṃ), not agitated (na paritassati) (i.e. freedomfrom-attachment is steady, content, not agitated). Therefore the
monk attains Nibbāna (S.3.53-4). This has been compared to a
ﬂame going out (‘The liberation of my mind was like the dying
of a ﬂame’: Thi116). This not-dependent-type viññāṇa is, simply
speaking, the end of the stream of ‘me’ and ‘mine’. It is equivalent to the destruction of greed, hatred and delusion (S.4.251). It
is the consciousness of the arahant.

Viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ anantaṃ sabbatopabhaṃ
‘Viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ anantaṃ sabbatopabhaṃ’ means viññāṇa
without attributes, everlasting, completely without a source.
I translate anantaṃ as ‘everlasting’ because v.886 says that Truth
is eternal (‘There are not many and various eternal Truths in the
world’: saccāni niccāni). Nibbāna should not be called ‘inﬁnite’
because Nibbāna is free of the sphere of inﬁnite space (na ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ) (Ud.80).
I take sabbatopabhaṃ to be sabbato apabhaṃ because Duroiselle
says that after ‘o’, vowels are usually elided – para26. Apabhaṃ
is derived from apabhavati or apahoti. Pabhava means ‘production, origin, source, cause’. The pabhava/pahoti alternative spelling
TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

143

WHAT IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN ARAHANT?

may explain the diﬀerent readings apabhaṃ (M.1.329) and apahaṃ
(D.1.223).
Sometimes the word sabbatopabhaṃ has been taken to mean sabbato pabhaṃ – ‘shining everywhere’. But it is unlikely that this
viññānam would shine everywhere because luminescence is not
an attribute of Nibbāna. Nibbāna has been called the Sublime
(paṇītaṃ), the Auspicious (sivaṃ), the Wonderful (acchariyaṃ), the
Amazing (abbhutaṃ) but not the Luminescent (S.4.360-373). In
fact Nibbāna is called ‘neither dark nor bright’ (D.3.251). It is
said of Nibbāna: ‘There gleam no stars, no sun sheds light, there
shines no moon, yet there no darkness reigns’ (Ud.p9).
Viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ (Nibbāna) is not reached by
• the solidity of solids – paṭhaviyā paṭhavittena ananubhūtaṃ
• the ﬂuidity of ﬂuids – āpassa āpattena ananubhūtaṃ
• the hotness of heat – tejassa tejattena ananubhūtaṃ
• the gaseousness of gas – vāyassa vāyattena ananubhūtaṃ
• the beingness of beings – bhūtānaṃ bhūtattena ananubhūtaṃ
• the godness of gods – devānaṃ devattena ananubhūtaṃ
• the allness of all – sabbassa sabbattena ananubhūtaṃ
(M.1.329).
Because viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ is not even reached by the four
great elements, the Buddha said it would be wrong to ask if
that is where ‘the four great elements cease without remainder’
(aparisesā nirujjhanti). Instead he said one should ask where they
have no footing (na gādhati). And because this viññāṇa is without attributes, ‘long and short, coarse and ﬁne, fair and foul,
Name and Form are all completely blocked’ (ettha dīghañca rassañca, aṇuṃ thūlaṃ subhāsubhaṃ; ettha nāmañca rūpañca asesaṃ uparujjhati) (D.1.223).
144

So where ‘the four great elements have no footing’ is where
Name and Form are completely blocked. ‘Completely blocked’ is
a synonym for ‘have no footing’. Unfortunately, asesaṃ uparujjhati
is often translated as ‘wholly destroyed’ – which makes nonsense
of the Buddha’s statement. Because he then would be reported
as saying that where the four great elements have no footing, in
that place (ettha) Form (rūpa) is wholly destroyed. And he would
thus apparently answer the very question he said should not be
asked.

Appendix 10
SHOULD MONKS FORSAKE PRECEPTS AND
PRACTICES?
The Octads warns that if one is tethered to precepts and practices,
one is likely to regard other people as inferior (v.798). Therefore
a monk should not be tethered to precepts and practices. He
should forsake them (v.839). This ‘forsaking’ has two possible
meanings: forsaking ineﬀective practices or forsaking the identiﬁcation with noble precepts.
Attaching to ineﬀective practices or identifying with noble precepts is called sīlabbataparāmāso, which is the third of the lower
fetters (orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni). This fetter is abandoned at
stream-entry (M.1.9); because one of the qualities of the streamenterer is the possession of virtues dear to the noble ones, unbroken, untorn, and not grasped (aparāmaṭṭhehi) (S.5.343) – a word
that implies not seeing them as ‘me’ or ‘mine’ or ‘my Self’ (etaṃ
mama esohamasmi eso me attā’ti) (S.2.94).
But forsaking precepts does not mean immoral behaviour.
What the Octads emphasises is good behaviour, as well as detachment. And detachment supports good behaviour not bad behaviour. Venerable Soṇa said the moral behaviour of an arahant
is a natural expression of an enlightened mind. When he was accused of practising harmlessness ‘due to blind attachment to precepts and practices’ (silabbataparāmāsaṃ), he said no, the arahant
is intent on non-harming because of the destruction of attachment, hate and delusion (khayā rāgassa vītarāgattā … dosassa vītadosattā … mohassa vītamohattā abyāpajjādhimutto hoti) (Vin.1.183-5).
Precepts and practices recommended by the Buddha are those
where skilful states (kusalā dhammā) grow and unskilful states
(akusalā dhammā) diminish (A.1.225). Stream-enterers discard
147

SHOULD MONKS FORSAKE PRECEPTS AND PRACTICES?

unskilful religious practices and undertake noble precepts, but
without grasping these precepts (aparāmaṭṭhehi); which means
that the stream-enterer does not see precepts as ‘me’ or ‘mine’
(S.2.94).
The following examples from the suttas illustrate how unskilful practices are discarded, and skilful practices are undertaken:
• Fire-worship: When Kassapa of Uruvela and his group of
matted hair ascetic disciples decided to take ordination under the Buddha, they ﬂung into the river their hair, braids,
bundles on carrying poles, and ﬁre-worshipping implements (Vin.1.32-3).
• Sacriﬁce: A brahman brought hundreds of bulls, goats and
sheep to the sacriﬁcial post for slaughter and burning, then
asked the Buddha how to perform the sacriﬁce so it would
be of the greatest beneﬁt. The Buddha replied that even in
preparing for such a sacriﬁce, thinking to make merit, one
makes demerit; thinking to do good, one does evil; thinking one is pursuing happiness, one is pursuing pain. Then
the Buddha explained that greed, hatred and delusion are
three ﬁres that should be shunned. He said that three ﬁres
should be venerated instead: one’s parents, one’s family,
and employees, ascetics and brahmans.
• River cleansing: The brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja asked
the Buddha if he ever went to the Bahukā River to bathe?
‘For in the Bahukā River many people wash away the evil
deeds they have done’. The Buddha replied that a ‘fool may
bathe there forever, yet will not purify his black deeds’. He
said that someone who is pure in heart and who does good
deeds is ever cleansed, and advised the brahman to bathe
in this way, to make himself a refuge for all beings, and to
keep the moral precepts (M.1.39).
148

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

• River cleansing: A brahman said to the bhikkhunī Punnikā:
‘Whoever, young or old, does evil kamma, is, through water ablution, from evil kamma set free’. Punnikā replied:
‘In that case, they would all go to heaven: all the frogs,
turtles, serpents, crocodiles, and anything else that lives in
the water’. She said that if these rivers could carry oﬀ evil
kamma, they would carry oﬀ merit as well. She advised
the brahman to stop doing whatever it was that made him
always need cleansing, and added ‘Don’t let the cold hurt
your skin’. The brahman said ‘I’ve been following the miserable path, good lady, and now you’ve brought me back to
the noble’ (Thi.p146).
• Worshipping and serving: One early morning, the Buddha
met a young brahman named Sigālaka, who, with clothes
and hair still dripping from his ritual bath, and with joined
palms, was worshipping (namassati) the six directions out
of respectful obedience to his father’s dying request that he
do so. The Buddha told Sigālaka that according to the noble
discipline (ariyassa vinaye) this was not the way to worship
the six directions, which Sigālaka then asked the Buddha
to explain. In fact, the Buddha explained, not how to ‘worship’ the six directions, but how to ‘cover’ them (paṭicchādī),
which he explained meant ‘serving’ the people in one’s life
(paccupaṭṭhātabbā) because it is likely that ‘worshipping’ was
a term that he felt should be used exclusively in relationship
to the Buddha, Dhamma and Saṅgha. He told Sigālaka how
to properly serve six groups of people: one’s parents, teachers, spouses, friends, servants, and ascetics and brahmans,
and how these can reciprocate by showing their tenderness
(anukampanti) in return. The Buddha said that if one follows this advice, then each direction is made safe, free of
fear (khemā appaṭibhayā) – possibly because one is not cultivating danger and fear within any relationship. Instead,

149

SHOULD MONKS FORSAKE PRECEPTS AND PRACTICES?

one is cultivating three qualities that might summarise the
Buddha’s advice to Sigālaka: respect, kindness and dutifulness (D.3.180).
• Purifying rites: Cunda was a silversmith whose purifying
rites involved him touching the ground, cowdung or grass,
worshipping ﬁre or the sun, and bathing three times a day.
The Buddha said that this was diﬀerent from noble puriﬁcation (ariyassa vinaye soceyyaṃ) which, at Cunda’s request,
he explained meant the four ways of right speech, the four
ways of right conduct, and freedom from covetousness, illwill and wrong views. These noble puriﬁcations result in
someone who is indeed pure (suci yeva hoti) whether or
not he practises touching the ground, worshipping ﬁre and
bathing three times a day, and they lead to happy rebirths,
either celestial or human (A.5.263-268).
• Going upwards: There is a brahman practice called ‘going
upwards’ (udayagāminiṃ nāma paṭipadaṃ) in which a disciple is told to get up early and walk facing east, and told
not to avoid a pit, a precipice, a stump, a thorny place, a
village pool, or a cesspool, and told to ‘expect death wherever you fall. Thus, good man, with the breakup of the
body, after death, you will be reborn in heaven.’ The Buddha said that this foolish practice does not lead to revulsion, dispassion, ending, peace, realisation, enlightenment
or Nibbāna. The practice called ‘going upwards’ in the Noble One’s Discipline (ariyassa vinaye udayagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ
paññāpemi) involves having unwavering faith in the Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha,and possession of the virtues dear
to the noble ones. This leads to utter revulsion, to dispassion, to ending, to peace, to realisation, to enlightenment,
to Nibbāna’ (S.5.361).
• Gruelling asceticism: Before his enlightenment, the Bud150

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

dha practised various ascetic practices. For instance, he
rejected social conventions by practising nakedness; by remaining standing when eating, urinating and defaecating;
by licking his hands clean instead of washing them. He tormented himself by standing continuously, rejecting seats;
or by maintaining the squatting position; by using a bed
of spikes; by bathing in cold water three times daily including the evening. He survived on very small amounts
of food, and reached a state of extreme emaciation. Yet by
such conduct and austerity he admitted that he did not attain any superhuman state of knowledge and vision that
was truly noble, because he did not attain noble wisdom
(ariyāya paññāya) which leads to the complete destruction
of suﬀering (M.1.81). Later, he was to reﬂect: ‘I am indeed
freed from that gruelling asceticism. It is good indeed that
I am freed from that useless gruelling asceticism. It is good
that, steady and mindful, I have attained enlightenment’
(S.1.103).

Appendix 11
THE STORY OF VENERABLE SOṆA
Venerable Mahākaccāna was one of the eminent disciples of the
Buddha, considered chief amongst monks who could explain
the brief sayings of the Buddha. He was born in Ujjenī town
(modern-day Ujjain) in a country called Avanti. This country,
now part of modern-day Madhya Pradesh, lay 400 kilometres
south-west of Sāvatthi, one of the centres of early Buddhism.
Having travelled to visit the Buddha and having attained arahantship, Mahākaccāna returned to Avanti.
Mahākaccāna had a lay supporter in Avanti called Soṇa
Kuṭikaṇṇa. Soṇa was keen to become a monk but Mahākaccāna
discouraged him by recounting the diﬃculties of the monks’ life:
‘Diﬃcult, Soṇa, for as long as life lasts are solitary sleeping places,
eating once a day and the brahmacariya (celibacy). Please, Soṇa,
remain a householder as you are and on the Observance days
practise the solitary sleeping place, the one meal a day and the
brahmacariya’. Soṇa was not to be discouraged, however, and
eventually Mahākaccāna agreed to ordain him. As Avanti was
so far from the centre of Buddhist practice in India, it took three
years to gather the necessary quorum of monks for the ceremony.
After spending his ﬁrst vassa (rainy season) in Avanti, Venerable Soṇa decided to visit the Buddha. When he asked for permission, Mahākaccāna told him: ‘Yes, very good, Soṇa. Go and
see the Sublime One, the Arahant, the perfectly and completely
awakened one. You will see the Sublime One, lovely to behold,
inspiring of conﬁdence, with senses calmed, with tranquil mind,
attained to the greatest self-mastery and serenity, who is tamed,
watchful, well controlled, a great being. In my name bow your
head to his feet and say: “My preceptor, Venerable Mahākaccāna,
153

THE STORY OF VENERABLE SOṆA

bows his head to your feet and asks if you are well, in good health,
with little illness, vigorous and abiding in comfort” ’.
With this, Soṇa set oﬀ and eventually arrived at Jeta’s Grove,
Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery in Sāvatthi, and paid his respects to
the Buddha. The Buddha told Venerable Ānanda to ‘Assign a
place for this visiting monk to rest’. Ānanda realised ‘The Lord
wants to share a dwelling with this visiting monk’ and assigned
him a place in the Buddha’s own dwelling.
The Buddha and Venerable Soṇa spent the early part of that
night meditating outside, then rested till early dawn. When the
Buddha arose, he invited Soṇa to recite some of the teachings.
Fulﬁlling this request, Soṇa recited the Group of Octads. When
he had ﬁnished, the Buddha praised him, saying:
‘Well done, monk! The Group of Octads is well memorised by
you. You have pondered it carefully, reﬂected upon it thoroughly.
You have a beautiful voice, a good delivery, and clear articulation. You made the meaning clear’ (Ud.57; Vin.1.193). The Buddha later declared ‘Chief among my monks of beautiful speech is
Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa’ (AN.1.24).

VENERABLE MAHĀKACCĀNA’S EXPLANATION
OF VERSE 844
Having forsaken the home-life: okaṃ pahāya
Not living in company: aniketasārī
The sage does not create intimate relationships in the
village: gāme akubbaṃ muni satthavāni
Rid of sensual passion: kāmehi ritto
Free of yearning: apurekkharāno
He would not speak to people contentiously: kathaṃ
na viggayha janena kayirāti
(Verse 844)
Venerable Mahākaccāna’s explanation of this verse is as follows:
• ‘living the home-life’ (okasārī hoti) means one’s consciousness (viññāṇaṃ) is bound by attachment (rāgavinibaddha) to
the ﬁve khandhas – because here, the khandhas are called
the home of consciousness (viññāṇassa oko).
• ‘living homeless’ (anokasārī hoti) means overcoming one’s
desire and attachment for the ﬁve khandhas (yo chando yo
rāgo yā nandi yā taṇhā ye upayūpādānā cetaso adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā … anabhāvakatā āyatiṃ anuppādadhammā).
This explanation includes a reference to the practice of the
Tathāgata; therefore ‘living homeless’ implies arahantship.
• ‘living in company’ (niketasārī hoti) means the scattering
and bondage (visāravinibandhā) [of one’s mind] in the com155

pany of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and mental
objects.
• ‘not living in company’ (aniketasārī hoti) means overcoming
the scattering and bondage [of one’s mind] in the company
of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and mental objects.
This explanation includes a reference to the practice of the
Tathāgata; therefore ‘not living in company’ implies arahantship.
• ‘being intimate in the village’ (gāme santhavajāto hoti) means
living in association with laypeople, rejoicing at their happiness, sorrowing at their sorrow, and involving oneself in
their aﬀairs and duties.
• not being intimate in the village (gāme na santhavajāto hoti)
means avoiding such intimacy.
• ‘being not rid of sensual passion’ (kāmehi aritto hoti) means
one is not devoid of lust, longing, aﬀection, thirst, passion, and clinging in regard to sensual pleasures (kāmesu
avigatarāgo hoti avigatachando avigatapemo avigatapipāso avigatapariḷāho avigatataṇho).
• ‘being rid of sensual passion’ means being rid of such desires for sensual pleasure.
• ‘yearning’ (purekkharāno hoti) means wishing for the future:
May I have such a body in the future! May I have such sensations in the future!
• ‘free of yearning’ means not having such wishes.
• ‘speaking with people contentiously’ means telling people
‘You don’t understand this Dhamma and Discipline; but I
understand it. you’re practising incorrectly; I’m practising
correctly’ and other such speech .

DO ARAHANTS HAVE DIFFERENCES IN
OPINION?
Arahants do indeed have diﬀering views, but they do not fall into
conﬂict about it. For instance, in an attempt to put his own enlightenment into perspective, the Buddha claimed that in the past
and the future, too, there have been/will be other Buddhas equal
in enlightenment to himself (D.3.114). But Venerable Sāriputta
said that in his view, no one ever has been, or will be, more
enlightened than the Buddha. The Buddha did not argue. He
simply asked Venerable Sāriputta whether he had comprehensive knowledge of all Buddhas, past, present and future. Had
he not spoken boldly with a bull’s voice? Roared the lions’ roar
of certainty? Venerable Sāriputta admitted that although he did
not have such knowledge, in his opinion, whatever it is possible
for someone to achieve through eﬀort, that the Sublime One had
achieved (D.3.113).
Arahants can sometimes be criticised by other arahants for
their views. Once, Venerable Kappina the Great wondered:
“Should I go to an Observance or not? Should I go to
Saṅghakamma or not? In either case, I am puriﬁed with the highest puriﬁcation”. The Buddha told him “If you brahmans (arahants) do not honour the Observance, who will? You go along to
the Observance and Saṅghakamma. Do not not go”. “Yes, Lord”
Venerable Kappina replied (Vin.1.105).
On another occasion, when the Buddha dismissed the Saṅgha,
intending never to teach again, Venerable Sāriputta decided to
follow him into retirement to practise jhāna. Later the Buddha
told him: “Stop, Sāriputta! Never let such a thought arise in you
again!” But Venerable Mahāmoggallāna had decided to help lead
159

DO ARAHANTS HAVE DIFFERENCES IN OPINION?

the Saṅgha, together with Venerable Sāriputta. The Buddha told
him: “Very good, Moggallāna. Either I could lead the order, or
Sāriputta and Moggallāna could do so” (M.1.459).
Sometimes arahant monks oﬀer competing answers to riddles
– for instance at A.3.401 and M.1.212. Having collected the answers, when the monks asked the Buddha “Who of us spoke
well?” (kassa nu kho bhante subhasitanti), the Buddha replied “You
have all spoken well, each in his own way” (sabbesaṃ vo bhikkhave
subhāsitaṃ pariyāyena); then he added “Hear also from me [how I
would answer the riddle]”. And he gave his own solution.
On another occasion three arahants were discussing the three
types of monks called kāyasakkhi, diṭṭhappatto, and saddhāvimutto.
Each arahant had a diﬀerent opinion on which of the three types
of monk is most excellent and choice (abhikkantataro ca paṇītataro
cā) (A.1.118). The Buddha said the issue could not be decided
without knowing the spiritual attainments of each type of monk.
So arahants do indeed have diﬀerences of opinion, but without
falling into conﬂict.

TRANSLATION NOTES
Añña: auxiliary basis of attachment
Añña means ‘other, diﬀerent’. It occurs in various forms, the
meaning of which is usually self-explanatory. But I have called
aññena (vv.789, 813, 908) and aññato (v.790) ‘by means of an auxiliary basis of attachment’.
The key for this choice is found in v.789, aññena so sujjhati sopadhīko: ‘Then a person with one basis of attachment is intrinsically
puriﬁed by means of another’. Norman translates this as ‘He who
has acquisitions [which lead to rebirth] is puriﬁed by something
else [than the noble path].
As for na hi aññamokkhā (v.773), I take it to mean: there is no
liberation except in relation to the bondage of desire.

Avijjā: Dhamma blindness
Avijjā is usually translated as ‘ignorance’. But ignorance means
a lack of theoretical knowledge; for instance, consider Venerable Channa who, the sutta tells us, had theoretical knowledge
of Dhamma but did not really see it. He had to ask Venerable
Ānanda to teach him how to see it (me tathā dhammaṃ deseyya
yathāhaṃ dhammaṃ passeyyan’ti) (S.3.132). This shows that attainment of insight is a kind of seeing, and not the attainment of
theoretical knowledge. Thus, stream-entry is like being shown
the way when one is lost, or having a lamp brought into a dark
place, or attaining the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye (virajaṃ vītamalaṃ dhammacakkhuṃ udapādi) (D.1.110). Enlightenment is like
darkness being banished, and light arising (M.1.248); this occurs
161

TRANSLATION NOTES

when one knows and sees (evaṃ jānato evaṃ passato) the four
noble truths as clearly as if one were looking at ﬁsh in a crystal
clear pond (D.1.84).

Āsava: blinding tendencies
Regarding the word āsava, the PED notes the ‘diﬃculty of translating the term’. Norman leaves it untranslated. Horner agrees
that it has ‘always been a problem to translators’, but says that
the root sru ‘suggests a ﬂowing, discharge, leak, trickling, oozing, while the preﬁx ā-, especially with verbs of motion, means
towards’ (Middle Length Sayings, Vol.1, xxiii). The term occurs
only once in the Octads (v.913). I have called it ‘blinding tendency’ for the following reasons:
The ﬁrst three fetters (saṃyojanāni) are called āsavas to be forsaken by seeing (sakkāyadiṭṭhi vicikicchā sīlabbataparāmāso: ime vuccanti āsavā dassanā pahātabbā, M.1.9). But as signiﬁcant as the fetters themselves is the tendency to them, and one is not really
free of the fetters until one is also free of the tendency to them
(sakkāyadiṭṭhi sānusayā pahīyati … vicikicchā sānusayā pahīyati …
sīlabbataparāmāso sānusayo pahīyati … kāmarāgo sānusayo pahīyati
… byāpādo sānusayo pahīyati) (M.1.434). So āsava is synonymous
with saṃyojana together with anusayo.
At A.4.127, ‘wearing away of the āsavas (āsavānaṃ khīṇaṃ) is
synonymous with ‘the fetters being weakened and easily rotting
away’ (appakasireneva saṃyojanāni paṭippassambhanti pūtikānī bhavantī’ti). So again, āsavā implies saṃyojanā.
Āsavas are apparently the opposite of the inclination to Nibbāna. For while the āsavas might arise in one who does not develop the enlightenment factors (M.1.11), when a monk develops and cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment, he slants,
slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna (nibbānaninno nibbānapoṇo
nibbānapabbhāro) (S.5.75). So the āsavas are the inclination away
162

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

from Nibbāna.
Āsavas are the inclination of one’s mind (nati cetaso) that results
from wrong thoughts. For whatever a monk frequently thinks
about, that will become the inclination of his mind (yaññadeva
bhikkhave bhikkhu bahulamanuvitakketi anuvicāreti tathā tathā nati
hoti cetaso) (M.1.116). So a monk should not tolerate harmful
and unskilful thoughts. For whereas āsavas might arise in one
who does not remove harmful and unskilful thoughts, there are
no āsavas in one who removes them (M.1.11). So āsavas are the
harmful inclinations of the mind.
The three āsavas (kāmāsavo, bhavāsavo, avijjāsavo: M.1.55)
have their corresponding equivalents in the seven tendencies
(kāmarāgānusayo, bhavarāgānusayo, avijjānusayo: S.5.60). Thus each
āsava is equivalent to one of the tendencies:
• kāmāsavo is equivalent to kāmarāgānusayo: the tendency to
infatuation with sensual pleasure
• bhavāsavo is equivalent to bhavarāgānusayo: the tendency to
infatuation with states of existence
• avijjāsavo is equivalent to avijjānusayo: the tendency to
Dhamma blindness
But the three anusayas that are āsavas are conditions for
Dhamma blindness (āsavasamudayā avijjāsamudayo; āsavanirodhā
avijjānirodho: M.1.54). And these three anusayas are can therefore be called ’blinding tendencies’.
Āsavas, then, are the tendencies for the manifestation of three
blinding mental objects:
• the tendency to infatuation with sensual pleasure
(kāmāsavo);
• the tendency to infatuation with states of existence
(bhavāsavo);

• the tendency to Dhamma blindness (avijjāsavo) (S.5.56).

Khilo: hard heartedness
The word khilo occurs in verses 780 and 973. Both the PED and
Norman call it ‘barrenness of mind’. I call it ‘hard heartedness’.
This harmonises with khilo’s other meaning: ‘waste or fallow
land’. Verse 780 says that a monk who does not enter disputes
does not incline to hard heartedness. Verse 973 says a monk
should destroy the hard heartedness he might have for his fellows
in the holy life – (sabrahmacārīsu khilaṃ pabhinde). Thus the turning point in Venerable Channa’s practice was when he destroyed
his hard heartedness and opened himself up (āvīakāsi khilaṃ pabhindi). This led to him asking Venerable Ānanda for Dhamma
instruction (S.3.134).
Whoever is angry with his fellows in the holy life, displeased
with them, upset about them, become hard hearted (khilajāto)
does not incline to exertion (A.4.460). Whereas having a mind
that is sympathetic for all living beings (akhilaṃ sabbabhutesu) conduces to attaining rebirth in the Brahma realms (S.4.118).

Taṇhā: clinging
Taṇha is popularly called ‘craving’ (i.e. strong desire) or thirst.
But even Buddhas get thirsty and desire water (‘Ānanda, bring
me some water. I am thirsty (pipāsito’mhi) and will [want to] drink
(pivissāmī’ti)’ - D.2.128). Therefore translating taṇhā as ‘strong desire’ seems mistaken. In fact, the key to the meaning of taṇha
is not its strength, but its quality of ensnaring (jālinī), attaching
(visaṭā) and clinging (visattikā): “I will teach you the clinging that
ensnares, that ﬂows, that attaches, that clings to one” (A.2.212-3).
The Buddha said of himself “Within him, taṇhā no longer lingers,
entangling and binding, to lead him anywhere” (yassa jālinī visattikā taṇhā natthi kuhiñci netave) (S.1.107).
164

Clinging arises because of sensation (vedanāpaccayā taṇhā). And
because of clinging, there is ownership, which the suttas express
in three ways: taṇhāpaccayā upādānaṃ (clinging → ownership)
(S.2.1); upadhi taṇhānidāno (clinging → possession) (S.2.107-112);
taṇhaṃ paṭicca pariyesanā pariyesanaṃ paṭicca lābho (clinging →
pursuit → acquisition) (A.4.400-1);
Clinging, the second Noble Truth, leads to renewed existence
and is accompanied by enjoyment and love, seeking enjoyment
here and there; that is, clinging to sensual pleasure, to existence and to becoming (yāyaṃ taṇhā ponobhavikā nandirāgasahagatā tatra tatrābhinandinī seyyathīdaṃ: kāmataṇhā bhavataṇhā vibhavataṇhā). Clinging is what binds a man to saṃsāra (taṇhādutiyo
puriso dīghamaddhāna saṃsaraṃ) (A.2.9). Clinging is called the
seamstress; for it sews a man to this ever becoming birth (taṇhā hi
naṃ sibbati tassa tasseva bhavassa abhinibbattiyā) (A.3.399).
There is a sixfold body of clinging (chayime taṇhākāyā):
• clinging to visible forms: rūpataṇhā
• clinging to sounds: saddataṇhā
• clinging to odours: gandhataṇhā
• clinging to tastes: rasataṇhā
• clinging to tactile objects: phoṭṭhabbataṇhā
• clinging to mental phenomena: dhammataṇhā.
(S.2.3).
In the Octads taṇha is either related to the clinging to existence
(e.g. taṇhagataṃ bhavesu, v.776 ), or it is used with no particular object. For instance, a peaceful person is ‘free of clinging ’
(vītataṇho: v.849 ).

Upādāna: ownership or possession
Possession or ownership arises from clinging (taṇhā), and is fourfold:
• possession of sensual desire: kāmūpādānaṃ
• possession of views: diṭṭhūpādānaṃ
• possession of precepts and practices: sīlabbatūpādānaṃ
• possession of a theory of Self: attavādūpādānaṃ
The suttas show that ownership is intrinsic to all types of upādāna:
• Possession of sensual desire: sensual desire is gradually worn down, starting at stream-entry, because the
stream-enterer is apparently “not obsessed” (pariyuṭṭhito)
by sensual love (kāmarāga) or ill-will (byāpāda) (M.1.321-5);
the once-returner has “attenuated” lust, hatred and delusion (rāgadosamohānaṃ tanuttā); the non-returner has “destroyed” the ﬁrst ﬁve fetters (pañcannaṃ orambhāgiyānaṃ saṃyojanānaṃ parikkhayā) (M.1.34). Although oncereturners have attenuated lust, some lay people who attain this state maintain sexual relationships (A.5.137). Attachment to sexual pleasure means that states of greed, hatred and delusion (lobha, dosa, moha) can still invade the
mind and remain (cittaṃ pariyādāya tiṭṭhanti) (S.5.369) even
though one sees that sensuality (kāmā) is of full of sorrow and danger (M.1.91; S.5.369). These unwholesome
states are only overcome when one attains the rapture and
bliss (pītisukhaṃ) that is free of sensuality (aññatreva kāmehi)
and unskilful states (akusalehi dhammehi) (M.1.91). At this
stage, the once returner would presumably become a nonreturner. This suggests that non-returners are free of the
166

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

fourth and ﬁfth fetters because they can enter jhāna, and
once-returners, at least some of them, cannot seem to do
this.
• Possession of views: If views are seen as not mine; not what
I am; not my Self then they are abandoned (evametāsaṃ
diṭṭhīnaṃ pahānaṃ hoti evametāsaṃ diṭṭhīnaṃ paṭinissaggo
hoti) (M.1.40).
• Possession of precepts and practices: Religious practices
that are not in accordance with the noble discipline (ariyassa
vinaye) are discarded by disciples when they ﬁrst take
refuge in the Buddha, and see that these practices are ineﬀective for spiritual progress. In their place, noble precepts are undertaken; thus the stream enterer is ‘possessed
of the precepts dear to the noble ones’ (ariyakantehi sīlehi
samannāgato hoti) which are perfectly fulﬁlled, but they are
not grasped (aparāmaṭṭhehi): a word that implies that one
does not see things as ‘me’ or ‘mine’ or ’my Self’ (S.2.94).
• Possession of a theory of Self: The insight of streamenterers and of arahants is identical: both have seen the ﬁve
khandhas as they actually are with proper wisdom as being not personal (netaṃ mama, neso hamasmi, na meso attā’ti)
(M.1.234-5). In stream-enterers, however, the presumption
of a ‘me’ is still found (asmī’ti adhigataṃ). But in relation to
any particular one of the khandhas “This is me” is not found
(ayamahamasmī’ti ca na samanupassāmī’ti) (S.3.127-133).
Venerable Khemaka said the presumption of a Self was
like the perfume of a lotus that could not be said to belong to any particular part of the ﬂower, it belongs to the
whole ﬂower. In the same way, he said that though a noble disciple has abandoned the ﬁve lower fetters, still, in
relation to the ﬁve aggregates subject to clinging, there
TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

167

TRANSLATION NOTES

lingers in him a residual tendency to think in terms of ‘me’
that has not yet been uprooted (asmi’ti anusayo asamūhato)
(S.3.127-133). Venerable Khemaka explained that if the disciple dwells examining the rise and fall in the ﬁve aggregates (udayabbayānupassī viharati), those residual tendencies
are uprooted, just as the smell that remains in cloth that is
cleaned with cowdung would eventually vanish if the cloth
was left in a sweet-scented casket.

Diṭṭhi: ﬁxed view
In the Octads, diṭṭhi usually implies attachment, and therefore I
have often called it ‘ﬁxed view’ not simply ‘view’. A ﬁxed view is
synonymous with a conclusion (v.781); it is regarded as the highest Goal by the person grasping it (vv.796, 833). It is a source
of confrontation (v.833) or oﬀensive behaviour (v.847). It is regarded as belonging to oneself (v.846) and may lead grading others as equal, inferior or superior (v.799) or to think one is perfected (v.889).
It is not always necessary to call diṭṭhi ‘ﬁxed view’. For instance
in verse 796, where it is already clear that attachment is involved:
‘If a person maintains that of views (‘ﬁxed views’), his is the highest Goal / Holding it as supreme in the world / And says that all
other views (‘ﬁxed views’) are contemptible / Then he has not
gone beyond disputes’.

Dhammesu niccheyya samuggahītaṃ: in regards to
dogmatic religious teachings
This phrase occurs in four places, vv.785, 801, 837, 907. It can be
analysed as follows:
• dhammesu: locative plural of dhammā, religious teachings:
‘in regards to religious teachings’.
168

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

• niccheyya: potential case of nicchināti: ﬁt to be (must be,
ought to be, to be) discriminated, considered, investigated,
ascertained (Duroiselle para 466).
• samuggahītaṃ: past participle of samuggaṇhāti:
grasped, embraced.

seized,

Together, this means ‘in regards to religious teachings which
must be ascertained [only] after having grasped them’ which I
have phrased as ‘in regards to dogmatic religious teachings’. Norman phrases it ‘grasped from among doctrines, after consideration’.
For example, Norman translates v.837: “ ‘Māgandiya’, said the
Blessed One, ‘nothing has been grasped [by me] from among the
doctrines, after consideration, [saying,] ‘I profess this’. Whereas I
have said ‘In regards to dogmatic religious teachings, of none of
them have I said ‘I proclaim this’ ”.

Paramaṃ: the highest Goal
In the suttas, Nibbāna is called the highest (paramaṃ) (e.g. Dh
v.184); or the highest happiness (paramaṃ sukhaṃ: Dh 203); or the
highest purity (paramaṃ suddhiṃ S 1.166); or the highest Nibbāna
in this lifetime (paramadiṭṭhadhammaṃ nibbānaṃ (A.5.64); or the
highest Goal (paramattha: Sn.v.68; v.219). In the Octads it is simply
called paramaṃ; but if one precisely translates that as ‘highest’ it
could lead to misunderstandings. For instance, v.796 would be
translated ‘If a person maintains that of views, his view is the
highest … Then he has not gone beyond disputes’. Therefore I
translate it ’If a person maintains that of views, his view is the
highest Goal … Then he has not gone beyond disputes’.

Yametamatthaṃ: ‘which you mentioned’
Yametamatthaṃ occurs in vv.838, 869, 870 – where it introduces a
question referring back to a word or phrase used by the Buddha.
Norman calls it ‘that thing which is’. PED says the dependent
and elliptic use of ya with a demonstrative pronoun represents
a deictic or emphatic use, with reference to what is coming next
or what forms the necessary compliment to what is just being
said. Thus it introduces a general truth or deﬁnition, as we would
say ‘just this’, ‘namely’, ‘that is’. PED says attha means ‘matter’,
‘aﬀair’ or ‘thing’. So yametamatthaṃ would mean ‘just this matter’.
Fausbøll phrases it ‘which thou mentionest’.

Sañña: ﬁctitious perceptions & Papañcasaṅkhā: the
conception of ‘me’
One of the key themes of the Octads is sañña – popularly called
‘perception’, though the PED says it can mean ‘conception, idea,
notion’. The word occurs in seven verses. It has two varieties:
good types and bad types. The single good-type occurrence is
found in v.841, where Māgandiya was expected to have the simplest notion (aṇumpi saññaṃ) of what the Buddha was talking
about. The other occurrences are all of bad types.
Overcoming the bad types of saññaṃ leads to dramatic results.
The Octads says that the sage who understands saññaṃ crosses
the ﬂood of sorrow (v.779), and says that if one is unattached to
saññaṃ, there are no bonds (ganthā) (v.847). Verse 802 says the arahant does not concoct the slightest saññā regarding what is seen,
heard or cognised (diṭṭhe va sute mute vā pakappitā natthi aṇūpi
saññā). This shows that saññā can hardly mean simply perception;
after all, the Buddha was able to perceive the people he was talking to. Alternatively in the Octads, saññaṃ has the same meaning
as it does in the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta (MN 18), where the Buddha
170

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

said that saññā do not linger in the arahant (saññā nānusenti). But
what does saññā mean, then?
In the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta, the Buddha said that the phrase
‘saññā do not linger’ means that if one does not enjoy, welcome or take hold of papañcasaññāsaṅkhā, this puts an end to the
seven latent tendencies. This statement also seems to say that if
one does not take hold of papañcasaññāsaṅkhā, then these papañcasaññāsaṅkhā do not linger. Thus saññaṃ seems equivalent to
papañcasaññāsaṅkhā. And papañcasaññāsaṅkhā is likely to be the
meaning of sañña in the Octads, too. But if, in the Octads, saññaṃ
is a synonym of papañcasaññāsaṅkhā, in what way does it diﬀer
from papañcasaṅkhā, of which it is said to be the source (v.874)?
Verse 916 says the basis of papañcasaṅkhā is the thought ‘I am’
(mūlaṃ papañcasaṅkhāya mantā asmīti sabbamuparundhe), and the
Buddha said when there is the thought ‘I am’ (asmīti sati), there
comes another seventeen thoughts : I am in this world; I am thus;
I am otherwise; I am bad; I am good etc. (A.2.212-3). From this,
it would seem that ‘I am’ is the root of seventeen other thoughts,
and that all these thoughts comprise papañcasaṅkhāya. Therefore
papañcasaṅkhā could be called ‘the conception of me’. My translation leads to the following results in the two mentions of the
word in the Octads:
• v.874: Fictitious perceptions are indeed the source of the
conception of ‘me’: saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā
• v.916: A sage should completely restrain the basis of the
conception of ‘me’: the thought ‘I am’: mūlaṃ papañcasaṅkhāya mantā asmīti sabbamuparundhe
In the Octads, papañcasaṅkhā is a further development of
saññā, because, says v.874, the source of papañcasaṅkhā is saññā
(saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā). And if papañcasaṅkhā is ‘the
conception of me’, the meaning of saññā can be found in the
TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

TRANSLATION NOTES

Mūlapariyāya Sutta where it says that ordinary person (assutavā
puthujjano) perceives earth as ‘earth’ (pathaviṃ pathavito sañjānāti).
Having done so, he then conceives ‘earth is mine’ (pathaviṃ
meti maññati). This is because he has not comprehended earth
(apariññātaṃ tassā’ti). If the expression ‘earth is mine’ can be taken
as equivalent to ‘the conception of me’ (papañcasaṅkhā), then it
becomes clear that it is the perception of an ordinary person that
leads to the conception of me. And this act of perception, called
sañjānāti, arises from non-comprehension (apariññātaṃ). And
such perception is not found in arahants. They do not perceive
earth as earth. Rather, arahants insightfully know earth as earth
(pathaviṃ pathavito abhijānāti); and having done so, they do not
conceive ‘earth is mine’ (pathaviṃ meti na maññati). Thus, in the
Octads, saññā is the perception of non-comprehension that gives
rise to the conception of me. It is not perception with insight. In
the Octads I call it ‘ﬁctitious perception’, because it involves perceiving what is not factual. This ﬁctitious perception is therefore
the source of the eighteen thoughts of ‘me’; in other words, the
source of the conception of ‘me’ is the ﬁctitious perceptions.
This gives the following results:
• v.779) Having understood ﬁctitious perceptions (saññaṃ
pariññā) … The sage crosses the ﬂood of sorrow.
• v.792) A person bound to ﬁctitious perceptions (saññasatto)
… goes high and low.
• v.802) Whoever does not concoct the slightest ﬁctitious perception (aṇūpi saññā) regarding what is seen, heard or cognised … how could anyone have any doubts about him?
• v.841) Asking questions that are based on a ﬁxed view, you
cannot apprehend the simplest notion (nāddakkhi aṇumpi
saññaṃ).
172

• v.847) For one unattached to ﬁctitious perceptions, there
are no bonds (saññāvirattassa na santi ganthā) … Those attached to ﬁctitious perceptions and to views / Roam the
world oﬀending people.
• v.874) Fictitious perceptions are indeed the source of the
conception of ‘me’ (saññānidānā hi papañcasaṅkhā).
• v.886) Apart from the mere notion of it (aññatra saññāya),
there are not many and various eternal Truths in the world.

conception of ‘me’: the thought ‘I am’ (mūlaṃ papañcasaṅkhāya mantā asmīti sabbamuparundhe)

Sati: ‘attentiveness’
Summary
Sati is popularly called mindfulness. But ‘mindful’ means ‘bearing in mind’, which is not the meaning of sati. I have called it
‘attentiveness’. Various quotes in the Ānāpānasati Sutta support
this.

Outline
The Satipaṭṭhānā Sutta indicates that sati has ﬁve qualities.
1. it has four ﬁelds of activity: (1) body (kāye kāyānupassī)
(2) sensation (vedanāsu vedanā) (3) mind (citte cittā) and (4)
the Buddha’s teaching models (dhammesu dhammā). Sati involves observing various aspects within these four ﬁelds
(anupassī viharati).
2. one should observe enthusiastically (ātāpī)
3. one should observe fully conscious (sampajāno)
TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

173

TRANSLATION NOTES

4. one should observe attentively (satimā)
5. one should observe having removed covetousness and
distress for the world (vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ)
(S.5.141).
Various other aspects of sati are further explained in the Ānāpānasati Sutta (MN 118).

Aspects of sati in the Ānāpānasati Sutta
• When a monk is practising attentiveness with breathing
(ānāpānasati) the Buddha called it kāye kāyānupassī because
‘Whenever, Ānanda, a monk knows: ‘I breathe in/out
long/short’; or trains himself ‘Experiencing/tranquillising
the whole body, I will breathe in/out’; on that occasion the
monk dwells observing kāye kāya. For what reason? (taṃ
kissa hetu). I call this a certain aspect of body (kāyaññatara),
Ānanda, that is, breathing in and breathing out’ (yadidaṃ
assāsapassāsaṃ). This shows that kāye kāyānupassī means observing certain aspects of the body. This is usually – unhelpfully – called ‘seeing the body in the body’.
• The Ānāpānasati Sutta says that the second ﬁeld of activity
of sati is called vedanāsu vedanānupassī because ‘I call this a
certain aspect of sensation (vedanaññatarāhaṃ) Ānanda, that
is, close attention (sādhukaṃ manasikāraṃ) to breathing in
and breathing out’.
• The Ānāpānasati Sutta says that the third ﬁeld of activity
of sati is called citte cittānupassī because ‘there is no development of samādhi with ānāpānasati if one’s attentiveness
is muddled (muṭṭhassatissa), if one is not fully conscious’
(asampajānassa).
174

TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

• The Ānāpānasati Sutta says that the fourth ﬁeld of activity
of sati is called dhammesu dhammānupassī because ‘having,
with wisdom, seen the abandoning of covetousness and
distress, a monk is one who looks on closely with equanimity’ (so yaṃ taṃ hoti abhijjhādomanassānaṃ pahānaṃ taṃ
paññāya disvā disvā sādhukaṃ ajjhupekkhitā hoti).
In conclusion, sati means the enthusiastic observation of various aspects of the body, sensation, the mind, or of various Dhammas, and involves close attention, a mind that is unmuddled,
fully conscious, equanimous, and free of covetousness and distress. I call this state ‘attentiveness’.

Pajahati: ‘detach from’
One of the most interesting words of the Octads is pajahati (as well
as three similar verbs: jahati, nissajjati, and paṭinissajjati). The PED
calls them: give up, renounce, forsake, abandon, eliminate, let go,
get rid of. In most verses, any of these would seem satisfactory.
However, verse 900 would be problematic because it would imply
that an arahant is “one who has given up precepts” (sīlabbataṃ
vāpi pahāya). This seems unlikely.
What the Octads emphasises is good behaviour, as well as detachment. Venerable Soṅa said the moral behaviour of an arahant
is a natural expression of an enlightened mind. When he was accused of practising harmlessness due to blind attachment to rituals and asceticism (silabbataparāmāsaṃ), he said no, the arahant
is intent on non-harming because of the destruction of greed, hatred and delusion (khayā rāgassa vītarāgattā … dosassa vītadosattā
… mohassa vītamohattā abyāpajjādhimutto hoti) (Vin.1.183-5).
These four Pāḷi words therefore seem in fact to mean the opposite of grasping. ‘Let go’ would have been the easy choice, but it
has a range of dubious meanings, including that of not keeping
to a moral standard. So I translate the four words as: ‘detach’.
TEST PRINT • TRANSLATION TO BE REVISED

175

TRANSLATION NOTES

The arahant has therefore ‘detached’ from precepts, rather than
‘let go’ of them. This translation harmonises with verse 798 which
says a monk should ‘not be tethered’ (na nissayeyya) to precepts. It
also harmonises with verse 791 which describes a monkey releasing one branch in order to seize another (purimaṃ pahāya aparaṃ
sitāse). A slight exception occurs with the word vippajahe at v.926,
which I call “he should abandon” (laziness, deception, merriment etc), rather than “he should detach” from these things.

Instrumental and ablative cases as ‘intrinsic’
One of the challenges of the Octads is not just in discriminating
grammatical case endings, but in discriminating sense vs. nonsense for any particular case. For example, if someone claims that
purity is on account of one’s views, does it mean that
• purity is spoken of on account of one’s views?
• Or, purity is achieved on account of one’s views?
The Buddha’s conversation with Māgandiya at verses 835-841
revolves around this dilemma. Māgandiya asks the Buddha:
This inner peace, whatever it is,
How is it explained by the wise?
The Buddha replies:
They do not say that purity is on account of one’s
views
Learning, knowledge, or precepts and practices;
Nor on account of one’s lack of views,
Learning, knowledge, precepts and practices.
But by detaching from these,
Not grasping them,

At peace, untethered,
One no longer hungers for existence.
Na diṭṭhiyā na sutiyā na ñāṇena sīlabbatenāpi na suddhimāha
Adiṭṭhiyā assutiyā añāṇā asīlatā abbatā nopi tena
Ete ca nissajja anuggahāya santo anissāya bhavaṃ na jape.
The ﬁrst phrase of the Buddha’s reply to Māgandiya in the instrumental case, the second, the ablative case. But the translation
of both is probably identical – and Norman agrees. He translates
it ‘not by view … not by absence of view’.
Duroiselle conﬁrms this. He says:
1. the ablative case can be translated as ‘on account of’ or
‘by reason of’ and he says the same for the instrumental
case – see next. Thus he says sīlato naṃ pasaṃsanti means
‘they praise him for [i.e. on account of] his virtue’ (Practical Grammar of the Pali Language: paragraph 600, xi).
2. the instrumental case ‘shows cause or reason’ and can
‘therefore be translated by such expressions as: by means
of; on account of; through; by reason of; owing to’.
Duroiselle gives the example: kammuna vasalo hoti, he is
pariah by reason of [i.e. on account of] his work (paragraph
599, ii).
3. The instrumental and ablative cases are interchangeable.
Duroiselle says that for an ablative meaning, the instrumental case ‘may be used as well’ (599, xi); and that ‘the ablative
is very frequently used instead of the instrumental’ (599,
xv).
Norman has translated verse 839 as ‘purity is not by view, by
learning, by knowledge, or even by virtuous conduct and vows’.

TRANSLATION NOTES

This leaves the dilemma unresolved; but if it is taken to mean
‘purity is not achieved by means of view … etc.’ it would contradict much of Buddhist teaching; for instance, that right view
(sammādiṭṭhi) assisted by virtue/precepts (sīlānuggahitā) and wide
learning (sutānuggahitā) has enlightenment as its fruit (A.3.20);
that good conduct leads step by step to the summit (kusalāni sīlāni
anupubbena aggāya parentīti). And there would be no point in the
Buddha answering Venerable Sāriputta’s question in v.961, about
what a monk’s precepts and practices should be.
What purpose is served by having the Buddha contradict himself in the Discourse with Māgandiya, apart from undermining
the rest of his Dhamma teachings? We must dare to admit that although ﬁnal liberation means liberation even from the path, and
that nonetheless the path is the means to liberation. I describe
this further in the section ‘Goal and path: what is the relationship?’ on page 111.
One can translate the instrumental case in several ways. For
example ‘by means of’, ‘by reason of’, ‘on account of’.
However, none of these phrases really settles the confusion between
• the means by which purity can be spoken of, and
• the means by which purity can be achieved.
In this present translation, for clarity, for both the instrumental
and ablative cases I use the word ‘intrinsic’. Therefore I translate
the Buddha’s reply to Māgandiya as follows (v.839):
They do not say that puriﬁcation is intrinsic to views
Learning, knowledge, or precepts and practices;
Nor intrinsic to a lack of views,
Learning, knowledge, precepts and practices.

Miscellaneous translations
chanda: popularly called ‘desire’. But in the Octads, as with
taṇha, its basis is ignorance, so I call it ‘longing’.
dhamma/ā: I have called it ‘religious teaching/s’ or ‘teachings’
or the ‘Buddha’s teaching’ or ‘Truth’.
pakappitā: I have called ‘concocted’ (v.784) (PED says: arranged, planned, attended to designed, made). Norman
has ‘formed’. The word kappayanti is a synonym (vv.794;
803). At v.784 saṅkhatā is a near synonym: ‘conjured up’.
Norman calls it ‘constructed’.
purakkharoti: PED calls it ‘follow’. But in the Octads it seems to
mean ‘blindly follow’. Norman calls it ‘prefer’.
brāhmaṇo: means Brahman i.e. arahant.
sacca/saccaṃ: I follow the PED in calling sacca ‘true’ (i.e. adjective); saccaṃ ‘Truth’ (i.e. noun).
